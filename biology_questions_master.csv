How do neurons encode information about stimulus intensity if action potentials are all-or-none?","The all-or-none principle states that once threshold potential is reached, an action potential will fire with maximum amplitude (approximately 100 mV change from -70 to +40 mV); stimuli below threshold produce no action potential, while stimuli above threshold produce identical action potentials regardless of stimulus strength. This principle ensures reliable signal transmission over long distances without degradation. However, neurons encode stimulus intensity through frequency coding (rate coding): stronger stimuli cause more frequent action potentials rather than larger ones. For example, a bright light causes photoreceptors to trigger more action potentials per second in the optic nerve than a dim light. Additionally, stronger stimuli may recruit more neurons (population coding). The all-or-none principle thus enables digital-like reliability while frequency and population coding provide analog information about stimulus properties.",Medium,"The all-or-none principle ensures consistent signal propagation, while the nervous system encodes stimulus intensity through the frequency of action potentials rather than their amplitude.
