How do neurons encode information about stimulus intensity if action potentials are all-or-none?","The all-or-none principle states that once threshold potential is reached, an action potential will fire with maximum amplitude (approximately 100 mV change from -70 to +40 mV); stimuli below threshold produce no action potential, while stimuli above threshold produce identical action potentials regardless of stimulus strength. This principle ensures reliable signal transmission over long distances without degradation. However, neurons encode stimulus intensity through frequency coding (rate coding): stronger stimuli cause more frequent action potentials rather than larger ones. For example, a bright light causes photoreceptors to trigger more action potentials per second in the optic nerve than a dim light. Additionally, stronger stimuli may recruit more neurons (population coding). The all-or-none principle thus enables digital-like reliability while frequency and population coding provide analog information about stimulus properties.",Medium,"The all-or-none principle ensures consistent signal propagation, while the nervous system encodes stimulus intensity through the frequency of action potentials rather than their amplitude.

Discuss why booster shots are sometimes necessary and provide an example of a vaccine that requires boosters.","Vaccination works by exposing the immune system to a harmless form of a pathogen or its antigens without causing disease, thereby inducing active immunity and immunological memory. Vaccines contain attenuated (weakened) pathogens, inactivated (killed) pathogens, subunit components (purified proteins), toxoids (inactivated toxins), or genetic material (mRNA or DNA) encoding pathogen proteins. When administered, these antigens activate B and T cells through the normal adaptive immune response: (1) Antigen-presenting cells process and present vaccine antigens; (2) Helper T cells are activated; (3) B cells are activated and undergo clonal selection and expansion; (4) Some B and T cells differentiate into memory cells that persist for years to decades. Upon subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen, memory cells enable a rapid, robust secondary immune response that neutralizes the pathogen before disease develops. Booster shots are sometimes necessary because memory cell populations and antibody titers can decline over time, particularly for antigens that don't provide strong initial immune stimulation. Boosters re-expose the immune system to the antigen, reactivating memory cells and generating additional memory cells, thus maintaining protective immunity.

Explain why two signals are required for T cell activation and what happens if only one signal is received.","T cell activation requires two distinct signals to prevent inappropriate immune responses: Signal 1 (Antigen Recognition): A T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell must recognize and bind to a specific antigen presented on an MHC molecule on an antigen-presenting cell (APC). For helper T cells (\ce{CD4+}), this is antigen-MHC II; for cytotoxic T cells (\ce{CD8+}), this is antigen-MHC I. The TCR-CD4/CD8 complex recognizes the antigen-MHC combination, providing specificity. However, this signal alone is insufficient for activation. Signal 2 (Co-stimulation): Co-stimulatory molecules on the APC (such as B7) must bind to co-stimulatory receptors on the T cell (such as CD28). This second signal confirms that the APC is a professional APC that has encountered genuine pathogen-associated signals, not just self-antigens. When both signals are present, the T cell becomes fully activated, proliferates (clonal expansion), differentiates into effector cells, and begins secreting cytokines. The two-signal requirement is a crucial safety mechanism: if a T cell receives only Signal 1 without Signal 2 (for example, by recognizing antigen on a non-professional APC or a tissue cell), the T cell enters a state of anergy (functional unresponsiveness) or undergoes apoptosis. This prevents autoimmune responses by ensuring T cells only activate in the context of genuine infection (when professional APCs are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns). This mechanism is exploited therapeutically: checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy block inhibitory co-stimulatory signals to enhance T cell activity against tumors.",Hard,"T cell activation requires dual signals: antigen recognition (specificity) and co-stimulation (confirmation of genuine threat).

Discuss the threshold percentage of vaccinated individuals needed and factors that influence this threshold.","Herd immunity (population immunity) occurs when a sufficient proportion of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, either through vaccination or prior infection, thereby providing indirect protection to non-immune individuals. When most people are immune, transmission chains are frequently broken because infected individuals encounter mostly immune people rather than susceptible ones, preventing epidemic spread. This protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for vaccines, immunocompromised individuals, those with allergies to vaccine components). The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is calculated as HIT = 1 - (1/R₀), where R₀ is the basic reproduction number (average number of people one infected person will infect). For highly contagious diseases like measles (R₀ ≈ 15-18), approximately 95% of the population must be immune. For less contagious diseases like influenza (R₀ ≈ 1.5-2), the threshold is lower (~50-70%). Factors influencing the threshold include: (1) Transmission mode—respiratory diseases spread more easily than contact-transmitted diseases; (2) Population density—urban areas require higher coverage than rural areas; (3) Contact patterns—diseases affecting children may require high childhood vaccination rates; (4) Vaccine efficacy—if vaccines are not 100% effective, higher coverage is needed. Herd immunity is a crucial public health concept that demonstrates how individual vaccination decisions affect community health. When vaccination rates drop below the threshold, outbreaks can occur even among vaccinated individuals, as seen in recent measles outbreaks in undervaccinated communities.",Hard,"Herd immunity protects the entire population, including vulnerable individuals, by reducing disease transmission when enough people are immune.

Substances filtered include water, glucose, amino acids, ions (\ce{Na+}, \ce{K+}, \ce{Cl-}, \ce{HCO3-}), urea, and creatinine. Blood cells and large proteins are retained.

Mechanism: The descending limb is permeable to water but impermeable to solutes. As filtrate descends through the increasingly hypertonic medullary interstitium, water leaves by osmosis, concentrating the filtrate. The thick ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports \ce{Na+}, \ce{K+}, and \ce{Cl-} out via the \ce{Na+}/\ce{K+}/2\ce{Cl-} cotransporter.

Vasa recta (blood capillaries) also flow in a countercurrent manner, removing reabsorbed water while maintaining the gradient. The gradient's importance: When dilute filtrate from the distal tubule enters the collecting duct, it passes through this osmotic gradient.

The amount of \ce{H+} secreted varies with blood pH—acidosis increases secretion, alkalosis decreases it. Secreted \ce{H+} is buffered in the filtrate by phosphate (\ce{HPO4^{2-} + H+ → H2PO4-}) and ammonia (\ce{NH3 + H+ → NH4+}), preventing excessive urine acidification. (2) Bicarbonate (\ce{HCO3-}) reabsorption: In the proximal tubule, secreted \ce{H+} combines with filtered \ce{HCO3-} to form carbonic acid (\ce{H2CO3}), which dissociates to \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O}. \ce{CO2} diffuses into tubule cells where carbonic anhydrase regenerates \ce{H2CO3}, which dissociates to \ce{H+} (for secretion) and \ce{HCO3-} (which is reabsorbed into blood). This mechanism reclaims virtually all filtered bicarbonate. During acidosis, the kidneys can also generate new bicarbonate through glutamine metabolism, where ammonia production consumes \ce{H+} and generates \ce{HCO3-} that enters the blood. The kidneys' pH regulation is slower (hours to days) than respiratory compensation (minutes) but more powerful and sustainable, capable of completely compensating for respiratory acidosis/alkalosis.

Targets collecting duct principal cells, increasing water permeability by inserting aquaporin-2 channels via cAMP signaling. Effect: increased water reabsorption, producing concentrated urine, which dilutes blood (lowers osmolarity) and increases blood volume/pressure. Does not directly affect sodium balance. Aldosterone: Released from adrenal cortex in response to low blood pressure (via RAAS—renin → angiotensin II), low blood \ce{Na+}, or high blood \ce{K+}.

Discuss the consequences of both dehydration and overhydration, and describe the hormonal mechanisms that prevent these conditions.","Proper fluid balance is essential for multiple physiological functions: (1) Maintenance of blood volume and pressure—adequate fluid ensures tissue perfusion and oxygen/nutrient delivery; (2) Temperature regulation—water has high heat capacity and enables evaporative cooling through sweating; (3) Waste elimination—sufficient water is needed to excrete metabolic wastes; (4) Cellular function—appropriate osmolarity is crucial for cell volume regulation and membrane potential. Dehydration consequences: Decreased blood volume → hypotension → reduced tissue perfusion and organ damage; increased blood osmolarity → cellular dehydration and dysfunction; thickened blood → increased clot risk; concentrated urine → kidney stone risk; severe dehydration causes shock, kidney failure, and death. Overhydration (water intoxication) consequences: Decreased blood osmolarity (hyponatremia) → water moves into cells by osmosis → cellular swelling, particularly dangerous in brain (cerebral edema) causing confusion, seizures, coma, and potentially death. Regulatory mechanisms preventing imbalance: (1) ADH system—osmoreceptors in hypothalamus detect increased osmolarity and trigger ADH release, promoting water retention; decreased osmolarity suppresses ADH, allowing water excretion; (2) Thirst mechanism—increased osmolarity or decreased blood volume stimulates thirst, promoting water intake; (3) RAAS system—decreased blood pressure triggers aldosterone release, promoting sodium (and water) retention; (4) Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)—released when atrial stretch increases (high blood volume), promotes sodium and water excretion.

Discuss how graded muscle contractions are achieved.","Individual muscle fibers follow the all-or-none principle: when stimulated by an action potential, a fiber contracts completely or not at all—there are no partial contractions of a single fiber. However, whole muscles produce graded contractions (varying force levels) through two mechanisms: (1) Motor unit recruitment (spatial summation): Muscles contain many motor units (one motor neuron + all fibers it innervates). The nervous system controls force by recruiting different numbers of motor units. Light tasks activate small motor units with few fibers; as more force is needed, progressively larger motor units are recruited (size principle). Maximum contraction involves all motor units. Different motor units have different fiber types (slow vs. fast), allowing both fine control and powerful contractions. (2) Frequency summation (temporal summation): Individual muscle twitches can summate if stimulated before complete relaxation. Low frequency stimulation produces separate twitches; higher frequency causes twitches to summate, producing greater tension. Very high frequency (tetanus) produces smooth, sustained maximal contraction as calcium remains elevated and cross-bridges continuously cycle. These mechanisms allow precise force control: motor unit recruitment adjusts force magnitude, while stimulation frequency modulates contraction smoothness. The all-or-none principle at the fiber level combined with these graded control mechanisms provides both reliability and versatility in muscle function.",Hard,"While individual fibers contract all-or-none, whole muscles achieve graded force through motor unit recruitment (how many fibers contract) and frequency summation (how often fibers are stimulated).

Relaxation mechanisms: (1) When stimulation ends, SR \ce{Ca^{2+}} ATPase pumps (SERCA pumps) actively transport calcium back into the SR, lowering sarcoplasmic concentration; (2) This requires ATP (about 30% of muscle ATP consumption at rest goes to calcium pumping); (3) As \ce{Ca^{2+}} dissociates from troponin, tropomyosin re-blocks binding sites; (4) If ATP is available, myosin heads detach and the muscle relaxes. Calcium regulation: The massive and rapid changes in calcium concentration (100-fold increase in milliseconds) require: tight storage in SR (calsequestrin buffers), rapid release channels (RyRs), powerful pumps (SERCA), and calcium buffers in the sarcoplasm.

This leads to multiple immature follicles (cysts), irregular cycles, and often anovulation. This question requires clinical application of hormonal regulation principles.",Consider a condition involving impaired follicle development despite pituitary activity.,1. Analyze hormone pattern: high LH, low FSH → abnormal ratio\n2. Consider effects: LH excess → androgen excess\n3. Low FSH → poor follicle maturation\n4. Multiple immature follicles form → cysts\n5. Clinical picture matches PCOS\n6. Answer: B
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology,Reproductive Hormones & Menstrual Cycle,FillBlank,"The transition from negative to positive feedback of estrogen on LH secretion occurs when estrogen concentration exceeds a threshold for at least ___ hours.",36,Hard,"When estrogen levels rise above approximately 200 pg/mL and remain elevated for 36+ hours, the feedback mechanism switches from negative to positive. This high sustained estrogen (from the dominant follicle) triggers the dramatic LH surge that causes ovulation. This is a critical timing mechanism ensuring ovulation occurs when a follicle is fully mature.",This timing mechanism ensures the follicle is mature before triggering ovulation.,1. Identify phenomenon: negative to positive feedback switch\n2. Recognize trigger: high sustained estrogen levels\n3. Recall time threshold: must be sustained\n4. Critical duration: approximately 36 hours\n5. Answer: 36 (or thirty-six)
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology,Reproductive Hormones & Menstrual Cycle,FreeResponse,"Compare and contrast the roles of FSH and LH in regulating the ovarian cycle. Include their effects on follicle development, ovulation, and corpus luteum function.","FSH and LH are both gonadotropins but have distinct roles. FSH primarily drives follicle recruitment and development in the early follicular phase by stimulating granulosa cell proliferation and estrogen synthesis. LH stimulates theca cells to produce androgens (substrate for estrogen) and triggers ovulation via the mid-cycle surge. After ovulation, LH maintains the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Both hormones work synergistically: FSH matures the follicle, making it responsive to LH, while LH provides the ovulation trigger and supports luteal function. Their coordinated action ensures proper timing of ovulation and hormone production.",Hard,"While both are pituitary gonadotropins regulated by GnRH and feedback mechanisms, FSH and LH have complementary but distinct functions across the ovarian cycle. Understanding their differential effects is key to grasping reproductive endocrinology and clinical interventions.",Consider how these two hormones divide labor across different phases and structures.,1. FSH role: follicle recruitment and growth (early follicular)\n2. FSH on cells: stimulates granulosa cells → estrogen production\n3. LH role: androgen production (theca cells) throughout cycle\n4. LH surge: triggers ovulation (mid-cycle)\n5. LH after ovulation: maintains corpus luteum → progesterone\n6. Synergy: FSH prepares follicle for LH sensitivity\n7. Formulate comparison including all phases
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology,Reproductive Hormones & Menstrual Cycle,MCQ,"At what point in the menstrual cycle would you expect to find the highest levels of both estrogen and progesterone?","[""A) Early follicular phase (days 3-7)"", ""B) Late follicular phase, just before ovulation (days 12-14)"", ""C) Mid-luteal phase (days 19-23)"", ""D) Late luteal phase, just before menstruation (days 26-28)""]",C,Medium,"During the mid-luteal phase, the corpus luteum is at peak activity, secreting high levels of both progesterone (highest of the cycle) and estrogen (second peak, though lower than the pre-ovulatory peak). This combination maintains the secretory endometrium. By the late luteal phase, the corpus luteum degenerates and both hormones decline sharply.",Think about when the corpus luteum is most active and what it secretes.,1. Review hormone patterns across cycle\n2. Follicular phase: estrogen rises, progesterone low\n3. Ovulation: estrogen peak, progesterone beginning to rise\n4. Early luteal: progesterone rising rapidly\n5. Mid-luteal (days 19-23): both hormones at peak from corpus luteum\n6. Late luteal: both declining as corpus luteum degenerates\n7. Answer: C
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology,Reproductive Hormones & Menstrual Cycle,MCQ,"Which of the following best explains why the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone during early pregnancy?","[""A) Continued pulsatile GnRH from the hypothalamus"", ""B) Sustained elevated FSH levels from the anterior pituitary"", ""C) hCG from the embryo binds to LH receptors on luteal cells"", ""D) Direct neural stimulation from the uterus to the ovary""]",C,Easy,"hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) secreted by the embryonic trophoblast has a similar molecular structure to LH and binds to the same receptors on corpus luteum cells. This 'rescues' the corpus luteum from degeneration, maintaining progesterone secretion until the placenta develops sufficiently (around week 10-12) to take over hormone production. This mechanism prevents menstruation and maintains the pregnancy.",Consider what signal the embryo must send to prevent the normal corpus luteum degeneration.,1. Normal scenario: corpus luteum degenerates without pregnancy\n2. Pregnancy scenario: corpus luteum must be maintained\n3. Identify embryonic signal: hCG (detected in pregnancy tests)\n4. Mechanism: hCG structurally similar to LH\n5. hCG binds LH receptors → maintains corpus luteum → progesterone continues\n6. Answer: C
