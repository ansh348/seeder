How do neurons encode information about stimulus intensity if action potentials are all-or-none?","The all-or-none principle states that once threshold potential is reached, an action potential will fire with maximum amplitude (approximately 100 mV change from -70 to +40 mV); stimuli below threshold produce no action potential, while stimuli above threshold produce identical action potentials regardless of stimulus strength. This principle ensures reliable signal transmission over long distances without degradation. However, neurons encode stimulus intensity through frequency coding (rate coding): stronger stimuli cause more frequent action potentials rather than larger ones. For example, a bright light causes photoreceptors to trigger more action potentials per second in the optic nerve than a dim light. Additionally, stronger stimuli may recruit more neurons (population coding). The all-or-none principle thus enables digital-like reliability while frequency and population coding provide analog information about stimulus properties.",Medium,"The all-or-none principle ensures consistent signal propagation, while the nervous system encodes stimulus intensity through the frequency of action potentials rather than their amplitude.

Discuss why booster shots are sometimes necessary and provide an example of a vaccine that requires boosters.","Vaccination works by exposing the immune system to a harmless form of a pathogen or its antigens without causing disease, thereby inducing active immunity and immunological memory. Vaccines contain attenuated (weakened) pathogens, inactivated (killed) pathogens, subunit components (purified proteins), toxoids (inactivated toxins), or genetic material (mRNA or DNA) encoding pathogen proteins. When administered, these antigens activate B and T cells through the normal adaptive immune response: (1) Antigen-presenting cells process and present vaccine antigens; (2) Helper T cells are activated; (3) B cells are activated and undergo clonal selection and expansion; (4) Some B and T cells differentiate into memory cells that persist for years to decades. Upon subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen, memory cells enable a rapid, robust secondary immune response that neutralizes the pathogen before disease develops. Booster shots are sometimes necessary because memory cell populations and antibody titers can decline over time, particularly for antigens that don't provide strong initial immune stimulation. Boosters re-expose the immune system to the antigen, reactivating memory cells and generating additional memory cells, thus maintaining protective immunity.

Explain why two signals are required for T cell activation and what happens if only one signal is received.","T cell activation requires two distinct signals to prevent inappropriate immune responses: Signal 1 (Antigen Recognition): A T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell must recognize and bind to a specific antigen presented on an MHC molecule on an antigen-presenting cell (APC). For helper T cells (\ce{CD4+}), this is antigen-MHC II; for cytotoxic T cells (\ce{CD8+}), this is antigen-MHC I. The TCR-CD4/CD8 complex recognizes the antigen-MHC combination, providing specificity. However, this signal alone is insufficient for activation. Signal 2 (Co-stimulation): Co-stimulatory molecules on the APC (such as B7) must bind to co-stimulatory receptors on the T cell (such as CD28). This second signal confirms that the APC is a professional APC that has encountered genuine pathogen-associated signals, not just self-antigens. When both signals are present, the T cell becomes fully activated, proliferates (clonal expansion), differentiates into effector cells, and begins secreting cytokines. The two-signal requirement is a crucial safety mechanism: if a T cell receives only Signal 1 without Signal 2 (for example, by recognizing antigen on a non-professional APC or a tissue cell), the T cell enters a state of anergy (functional unresponsiveness) or undergoes apoptosis. This prevents autoimmune responses by ensuring T cells only activate in the context of genuine infection (when professional APCs are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns). This mechanism is exploited therapeutically: checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy block inhibitory co-stimulatory signals to enhance T cell activity against tumors.",Hard,"T cell activation requires dual signals: antigen recognition (specificity) and co-stimulation (confirmation of genuine threat).

Discuss the threshold percentage of vaccinated individuals needed and factors that influence this threshold.","Herd immunity (population immunity) occurs when a sufficient proportion of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, either through vaccination or prior infection, thereby providing indirect protection to non-immune individuals. When most people are immune, transmission chains are frequently broken because infected individuals encounter mostly immune people rather than susceptible ones, preventing epidemic spread. This protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for vaccines, immunocompromised individuals, those with allergies to vaccine components). The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is calculated as HIT = 1 - (1/R₀), where R₀ is the basic reproduction number (average number of people one infected person will infect). For highly contagious diseases like measles (R₀ ≈ 15-18), approximately 95% of the population must be immune. For less contagious diseases like influenza (R₀ ≈ 1.5-2), the threshold is lower (~50-70%). Factors influencing the threshold include: (1) Transmission mode—respiratory diseases spread more easily than contact-transmitted diseases; (2) Population density—urban areas require higher coverage than rural areas; (3) Contact patterns—diseases affecting children may require high childhood vaccination rates; (4) Vaccine efficacy—if vaccines are not 100% effective, higher coverage is needed. Herd immunity is a crucial public health concept that demonstrates how individual vaccination decisions affect community health. When vaccination rates drop below the threshold, outbreaks can occur even among vaccinated individuals, as seen in recent measles outbreaks in undervaccinated communities.",Hard,"Herd immunity protects the entire population, including vulnerable individuals, by reducing disease transmission when enough people are immune.

Substances filtered include water, glucose, amino acids, ions (\ce{Na+}, \ce{K+}, \ce{Cl-}, \ce{HCO3-}), urea, and creatinine. Blood cells and large proteins are retained.

Mechanism: The descending limb is permeable to water but impermeable to solutes. As filtrate descends through the increasingly hypertonic medullary interstitium, water leaves by osmosis, concentrating the filtrate. The thick ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports \ce{Na+}, \ce{K+}, and \ce{Cl-} out via the \ce{Na+}/\ce{K+}/2\ce{Cl-} cotransporter.

Vasa recta (blood capillaries) also flow in a countercurrent manner, removing reabsorbed water while maintaining the gradient. The gradient's importance: When dilute filtrate from the distal tubule enters the collecting duct, it passes through this osmotic gradient.

The amount of \ce{H+} secreted varies with blood pH—acidosis increases secretion, alkalosis decreases it. Secreted \ce{H+} is buffered in the filtrate by phosphate (\ce{HPO4^{2-} + H+ → H2PO4-}) and ammonia (\ce{NH3 + H+ → NH4+}), preventing excessive urine acidification. (2) Bicarbonate (\ce{HCO3-}) reabsorption: In the proximal tubule, secreted \ce{H+} combines with filtered \ce{HCO3-} to form carbonic acid (\ce{H2CO3}), which dissociates to \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O}. \ce{CO2} diffuses into tubule cells where carbonic anhydrase regenerates \ce{H2CO3}, which dissociates to \ce{H+} (for secretion) and \ce{HCO3-} (which is reabsorbed into blood). This mechanism reclaims virtually all filtered bicarbonate. During acidosis, the kidneys can also generate new bicarbonate through glutamine metabolism, where ammonia production consumes \ce{H+} and generates \ce{HCO3-} that enters the blood. The kidneys' pH regulation is slower (hours to days) than respiratory compensation (minutes) but more powerful and sustainable, capable of completely compensating for respiratory acidosis/alkalosis.

Targets collecting duct principal cells, increasing water permeability by inserting aquaporin-2 channels via cAMP signaling. Effect: increased water reabsorption, producing concentrated urine, which dilutes blood (lowers osmolarity) and increases blood volume/pressure. Does not directly affect sodium balance. Aldosterone: Released from adrenal cortex in response to low blood pressure (via RAAS—renin → angiotensin II), low blood \ce{Na+}, or high blood \ce{K+}.

Discuss the consequences of both dehydration and overhydration, and describe the hormonal mechanisms that prevent these conditions.","Proper fluid balance is essential for multiple physiological functions: (1) Maintenance of blood volume and pressure—adequate fluid ensures tissue perfusion and oxygen/nutrient delivery; (2) Temperature regulation—water has high heat capacity and enables evaporative cooling through sweating; (3) Waste elimination—sufficient water is needed to excrete metabolic wastes; (4) Cellular function—appropriate osmolarity is crucial for cell volume regulation and membrane potential. Dehydration consequences: Decreased blood volume → hypotension → reduced tissue perfusion and organ damage; increased blood osmolarity → cellular dehydration and dysfunction; thickened blood → increased clot risk; concentrated urine → kidney stone risk; severe dehydration causes shock, kidney failure, and death. Overhydration (water intoxication) consequences: Decreased blood osmolarity (hyponatremia) → water moves into cells by osmosis → cellular swelling, particularly dangerous in brain (cerebral edema) causing confusion, seizures, coma, and potentially death. Regulatory mechanisms preventing imbalance: (1) ADH system—osmoreceptors in hypothalamus detect increased osmolarity and trigger ADH release, promoting water retention; decreased osmolarity suppresses ADH, allowing water excretion; (2) Thirst mechanism—increased osmolarity or decreased blood volume stimulates thirst, promoting water intake; (3) RAAS system—decreased blood pressure triggers aldosterone release, promoting sodium (and water) retention; (4) Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)—released when atrial stretch increases (high blood volume), promotes sodium and water excretion.

Discuss how graded muscle contractions are achieved.","Individual muscle fibers follow the all-or-none principle: when stimulated by an action potential, a fiber contracts completely or not at all—there are no partial contractions of a single fiber. However, whole muscles produce graded contractions (varying force levels) through two mechanisms: (1) Motor unit recruitment (spatial summation): Muscles contain many motor units (one motor neuron + all fibers it innervates). The nervous system controls force by recruiting different numbers of motor units. Light tasks activate small motor units with few fibers; as more force is needed, progressively larger motor units are recruited (size principle). Maximum contraction involves all motor units. Different motor units have different fiber types (slow vs. fast), allowing both fine control and powerful contractions. (2) Frequency summation (temporal summation): Individual muscle twitches can summate if stimulated before complete relaxation. Low frequency stimulation produces separate twitches; higher frequency causes twitches to summate, producing greater tension. Very high frequency (tetanus) produces smooth, sustained maximal contraction as calcium remains elevated and cross-bridges continuously cycle. These mechanisms allow precise force control: motor unit recruitment adjusts force magnitude, while stimulation frequency modulates contraction smoothness. The all-or-none principle at the fiber level combined with these graded control mechanisms provides both reliability and versatility in muscle function.",Hard,"While individual fibers contract all-or-none, whole muscles achieve graded force through motor unit recruitment (how many fibers contract) and frequency summation (how often fibers are stimulated).

Relaxation mechanisms: (1) When stimulation ends, SR \ce{Ca^{2+}} ATPase pumps (SERCA pumps) actively transport calcium back into the SR, lowering sarcoplasmic concentration; (2) This requires ATP (about 30% of muscle ATP consumption at rest goes to calcium pumping); (3) As \ce{Ca^{2+}} dissociates from troponin, tropomyosin re-blocks binding sites; (4) If ATP is available, myosin heads detach and the muscle relaxes. Calcium regulation: The massive and rapid changes in calcium concentration (100-fold increase in milliseconds) require: tight storage in SR (calsequestrin buffers), rapid release channels (RyRs), powerful pumps (SERCA), and calcium buffers in the sarcoplasm.

Explain why sticky ends are generally preferred in cloning applications.","Sticky ends (also called cohesive ends) are single-stranded overhangs produced when restriction enzymes make staggered cuts in the two DNA strands. Blunt ends result from enzymes that cut both strands at the same position, producing no overhangs. Sticky ends are preferred in cloning for several reasons: (1) Complementary sticky ends can base-pair with each other through hydrogen bonding, temporarily holding DNA fragments in correct alignment before ligation. This makes the ligation reaction much more efficient. (2) Sticky ends provide directionality - fragments can only join in specific orientations when complementary sequences must match. (3) The base-pairing holds fragments together even at lower DNA concentrations, while blunt-end ligation requires higher concentrations and often lower efficiency. Although blunt ends can join to any other blunt end (useful in some applications), they generally require more enzyme and produce less predictable results than sticky-end ligation.",Medium,"The key advantage of sticky ends is that complementary base pairing provides both stability and specificity during ligation.

Since DNA ligase requires a 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxyl group to form a bond, the plasmid cannot religate to itself. However, the insert (which retains its phosphates) can still ligate into the plasmid. (2) Use two different restriction enzymes: Cut the plasmid with two different enzymes that produce incompatible sticky ends. The two ends of the linearized plasmid cannot base-pair with each other (preventing self-ligation), but each can ligate to the corresponding end of the insert cut with the same two enzymes.

Plant cells: Cannot form a cleavage furrow because they have a rigid cell wall. Instead, they form a cell plate that grows outward from the center of the cell toward the cell membrane. Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus carrying cell wall materials gather at the cell's equator and fuse to form the cell plate, which eventually becomes a new cell wall separating the two daughter cells. These differences exist because: (1) Plant cells have rigid cell walls that cannot be pinched inward; (2) Animal cells lack cell walls and have flexible membranes that can be constricted; (3) Plant cells must synthesize new cell wall material to separate daughter cells, while animal cells only need to divide the membrane.

In a large cell with low SA:V, the distance from membrane to center is too great for efficient signaling. By remaining small, cells maintain a high SA:V ratio that ensures: sufficient membrane area for rapid exchange of materials, short diffusion distances from membrane to interior (typically $< 100 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$), and efficient metabolic function. Large organisms overcome size limitations not by having larger cells, but by having more cells.",Medium,"The SA:V ratio is a fundamental constraint on cell size because cellular functions depend on surface exchange (2D) while metabolic demands depend on cellular contents (3D). This mathematical relationship explains why cells have evolved to remain microscopic.","Explain what happens to SA:V as cells grow, then describe specific processes that depend on membrane surface area.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Cell Theory & Cell Size (SA:V),FreeResponse,"Some cells have adaptations that effectively increase their surface area without proportionally increasing their volume. Describe two examples of such adaptations and explain how they help overcome SA:V limitations.","Certain specialized cells have structural adaptations that increase surface area while minimizing volume increases: (1) Intestinal epithelial cells have microvilli: These are tiny finger-like projections on the cell surface that greatly increase the membrane area available for absorption. A single intestinal cell may have thousands of microvilli, collectively called a brush border. This adaptation is crucial because these cells specialize in absorbing nutrients from digested food, a process that requires maximum membrane surface area. The microvilli increase absorption surface area by approximately $20$-fold without significantly increasing cell volume. (2) Root hair cells in plants have elongated extensions: These thin, hair-like projections extend from root epidermal cells into the soil. Each extension dramatically increases the surface area for water and mineral absorption while adding minimal volume. A single root may have millions of these hair cells, maximizing the plant's ability to extract resources from soil. (3) Neurons have long, thin axons: While neurons can be very long cells, they maintain a thin diameter (high SA:V) along their length. This ensures adequate diffusion across the membrane while allowing long-distance signal transmission. These adaptations demonstrate that cells have evolved solutions to SA:V constraints without simply remaining small spheres. They increase functional surface area (for absorption, secretion, or signal reception) through projections, folds, and elongations while keeping the cell volume manageable. This allows these cells to perform specialized functions that require extensive membrane surface area.",Hard,"Structural modifications like microvilli, root hairs, and axons represent evolutionary solutions to SA:V constraints, allowing cells to maximize surface area for specific functions while maintaining efficient material exchange. These adaptations enable specialized cells to exceed the functional limitations of simple geometric shapes.","Think of cells whose function requires lots of membrane surface area and how their shape helps achieve this.","1. Some cells need very high surface area\n2. Example 1: Intestinal cells with microvilli\n3. Microvilli = tiny projections on surface\n4. Increases area without much volume increase\n5.
