The inner membrane is the original plasma membrane of the bacterium, while the outer membrane came from the host cell's membrane that formed the engulfing vesicle. This double membrane structure is key evidence for endosymbiosis. The two membranes have different compositions: the inner membrane resembles bacterial membranes (with proteins for electron transport), while the outer membrane is more similar to eukaryotic membranes.","Think about what happens when a cell engulfs something by endocytosis.","1.

Before this, Earth's atmosphere was essentially oxygen-free. The accumulation of $\\ce{O2}$ was initially toxic to many anaerobic organisms but eventually enabled the evolution of aerobic respiration and complex multicellular life.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Describe three pieces of evidence that support the endosymbiotic theory for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.","The endosymbiotic theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) Own DNA: Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own circular DNA molecules, similar in structure to bacterial chromosomes rather than linear eukaryotic chromosomes. This DNA encodes some (but not all) of the proteins these organelles need, suggesting they were once independent but have become dependent on the host cell over evolutionary time. (2) Own ribosomes: These organelles have $70$S ribosomes, identical to bacterial ribosomes, not the $80$S ribosomes found in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. These ribosomes are also sensitive to antibiotics that specifically target bacterial protein synthesis (like chloramphenicol), but not to antibiotics that target eukaryotic ribosomes. (3) Binary fission: Mitochondria and chloroplasts reproduce by binary fission (splitting in two), the same process bacteria use to divide, and they do this independently of the cell cycle. They cannot be created de novo - new mitochondria and chloroplasts only arise from pre-existing ones, just like bacteria. Additional evidence: (4) Double membrane with different compositions - inner membrane resembles bacterial membranes while outer resembles eukaryotic membranes; (5) Size similar to bacteria; (6) DNA sequence analysis shows mitochondria are most closely related to alpha-proteobacteria and chloroplasts to cyanobacteria. Together, this evidence strongly supports that these organelles descended from free-living bacteria that established endosymbiotic relationships with early eukaryotic cells.",Medium,"The evidence for endosymbiotic theory is compelling because it comes from multiple independent sources - genetics (DNA structure), biochemistry (ribosome type), cell biology (division mechanism), and molecular phylogenetics (DNA sequences). Each piece alone is suggestive, but together they create an overwhelming case for the bacterial origin of these organelles.","Structure answer around three main evidence types: DNA characteristics, ribosome type, and reproduction method.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Explain why the evolution of photosynthesis was crucial for the later evolution of complex life, including eukaryotes.","The evolution of photosynthesis, particularly oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, was transformative for Earth and essential for complex life: (1) Oxygen production: Photosynthetic organisms, especially cyanobacteria, released $\\ce{O2}$ as a waste product. Over hundreds of millions of years, this oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, changing it from anaerobic to aerobic (Great Oxygenation Event, ~$2.4$ billion years ago). (2) Enabled aerobic respiration: The accumulation of atmospheric $\\ce{O2}$ made aerobic respiration possible. Aerobic respiration produces far more ATP per glucose molecule (~$32$-$38$ ATP) compared to anaerobic fermentation (~$2$ ATP). This dramatic increase in energy availability enabled the evolution of larger, more complex organisms with higher energy demands. (3) Formation of ozone layer: Atmospheric oxygen led to the formation of the ozone ($\\ce{O3}$) layer in the upper atmosphere, which blocks harmful UV radiation. This made it possible for life to eventually colonize land surfaces. (4) Enabled endosymbiosis: The presence of aerobic bacteria (which evolved to use oxygen for respiration) created the opportunity for endosymbiosis. Early eukaryotic cells could engulf these aerobic bacteria, which became mitochondria, providing the host cell with efficient ATP production. (5) Energy for complexity: The high energy yield from aerobic respiration in mitochondria provided the power necessary for eukaryotic cells to maintain complex internal structures (nucleus, endomembrane system), active transport, and large cell size. Without photosynthesis, Earth would have remained an anaerobic world populated only by simple prokaryotes. Photosynthesis provided both the energy (through food webs) and the oxygen (for respiration) necessary for the evolution of eukaryotes, multicellular organisms, and eventually all complex life including animals and plants.",Hard,"Photosynthesis represents one of evolution's most significant innovations because it transformed not just individual organisms but the entire planetary environment. By producing oxygen, it created both a new energy source (aerobic respiration) and enabled endosymbiosis, setting the stage for the evolution of all complex life. This demonstrates how biological innovation can fundamentally alter evolutionary possibilities.","Explain oxygen production, how oxygen enabled aerobic respiration, and how this high energy enabled complex life and eukaryotes.","1. Photosynthesis evolved in cyanobacteria\n2. Produced $\\ce{O2}$ as waste\n3. Oxygen accumulated in atmosphere (GOE)\n4. Changed Earth from anaerobic to aerobic\n5.

The nucleus is thought to have evolved through invagination of the plasma membrane, not through endosymbiosis. Evidence FOR endosymbiotic theory includes: DNA sequence similarities between organelles and specific bacterial groups, binary fission reproduction, double membranes, own ribosomes, and circular DNA.

This process of gene transfer has created dependence - mitochondria and chloroplasts can no longer survive independently because they need proteins encoded by nuclear genes. Mitochondrial DNA in humans encodes only $13$ proteins, while mitochondria need over $1000$ proteins to function. The rest are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and imported into mitochondria. This gene transfer likely occurred because nuclear DNA has better repair mechanisms and is less exposed to reactive oxygen species than organellar DNA.","Think about the evolutionary relationship and gene transfer between organelles and nucleus.","1.

Aerobic bacteria could use oxygen to break down glucose completely, generating much more ATP (~$32$-$38$ per glucose) than anaerobic fermentation (~$2$ ATP per glucose). This energy advantage allowed eukaryotic cells to grow larger, maintain complex internal structures, and evolve new capabilities. The aerobic bacterium gained protection and nutrients from the host. This mutual benefit made the relationship stable over evolutionary time.","Consider what aerobic bacteria can do that anaerobic cells cannot.","1. Aerobic bacteria use oxygen for respiration\n2.

RNA can both store genetic information (like DNA) and catalyze reactions (like enzymes). RNA molecules with catalytic activity are called ribozymes. This hypothesis helps explain the origin of life by showing how a single molecule type could fulfill multiple functions before the evolution of specialized DNA (for information storage) and proteins (for catalysis). Evidence includes the discovery of ribozymes and the fact that ribosomes use RNA to catalyze peptide bond formation.","This hypothesis suggests RNA came before DNA and proteins in evolution.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FillBlank,"The primitive soup of organic molecules that may have existed on early Earth, from which life could have originated, is often called the primordial ___.",soup,Easy,"The primordial soup (or prebiotic soup) refers to the hypothetical mixture of organic compounds that accumulated in Earth's early oceans. These organic molecules - amino acids, nucleotides, sugars, and lipids - could have formed through abiotic synthesis (chemical reactions without life). Experiments like Miller-Urey (1953) showed that organic molecules can form from inorganic precursors under conditions simulating early Earth. From this primordial soup, increasingly complex molecules could have formed, eventually leading to self-replicating systems and the first cells.","This term describes the mixture of organic molecules in Earth's early oceans.","1.

DNA sequence analysis shows chloroplasts are most closely related to cyanobacteria. When an early eukaryotic cell (possibly one that already had mitochondria) engulfed a cyanobacterium, it gained the ability to photosynthesize. This explains why only some eukaryotes (plants and algae) have chloroplasts, while all eukaryotes have mitochondria - chloroplast endosymbiosis occurred later and in fewer lineages.","These photosynthetic bacteria are blue-green and still exist today.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FillBlank,"The process by which a cell membrane surrounds and engulfs an external particle, bringing it into the cell, is called ___.",endocytosis,Medium,"Endocytosis is the process by which cells engulf external materials by wrapping them in a portion of the cell membrane, forming a vesicle. This is how endosymbiosis likely occurred - a primitive eukaryotic cell engulfed an aerobic bacterium through endocytosis, but instead of digesting it, established a symbiotic relationship. Types of endocytosis include phagocytosis (engulfing particles) and pinocytosis (engulfing liquids). The engulfing of bacteria to form mitochondria and chloroplasts was probably phagocytosis.","This process wraps external materials in membrane to bring them inside the cell.","1. Cells can take in external materials\n2. Membrane surrounds material\n3. Forms vesicle inside cell\n4. This process is endocytosis\n5. Likely mechanism for endosymbiosis\n6. Answer: endocytosis"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Explain the sequence of events in endosymbiotic theory, describing how mitochondria became established in eukaryotic cells.","The endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria occurred through this sequence: (1) Initial state: Early eukaryotic ancestor existed, possibly anaerobic, with a nucleus and flexible cell membrane but no mitochondria. The cell could perform endocytosis. Meanwhile, aerobic bacteria evolved that could use oxygen for efficient respiration. (2) Engulfment: The ancestral eukaryotic cell engulfed an aerobic bacterium through endocytosis (phagocytosis). The bacterium was surrounded by a membrane vesicle derived from the host cell's membrane. (3) Avoidance of digestion: Instead of being digested by lysosomes (as would normally happen), the bacterium survived inside the host cell. This may have occurred due to beneficial molecules the bacterium produced, or resistance to the host's digestive enzymes. (4) Establishment of symbiosis: The bacterium produced ATP efficiently through aerobic respiration and shared this ATP with the host cell, providing an energy advantage. The host cell provided the bacterium with protection and nutrients (glucose, oxygen). This mutualistic relationship benefited both partners. (5) Gene transfer and integration: Over evolutionary time, many bacterial genes were transferred to the host nucleus. The bacterium became dependent on nuclear genes and could no longer survive independently. The host became dependent on the bacterium for efficient ATP production. (6) Vertical inheritance: The endosymbiont reproduced by binary fission inside the host and was passed to daughter cells during cell division. Over millions of years, this relationship became permanent, and the endosymbiont evolved into mitochondria. Result: All descendant eukaryotic cells inherited mitochondria, making them essential organelles that retain bacterial characteristics (own DNA, ribosomes, division mechanism) while being fully integrated into eukaryotic cell function.",Hard,"The endosymbiotic process demonstrates how cooperation between different organisms can drive major evolutionary transitions. What began as a chance engulfment event became a permanent partnership that enabled the evolution of complex eukaryotic life. The integration was so successful that mitochondria are now essential and inseparable from their host cells.","Describe the steps: ancestral cells exist, engulfment occurs, symbiosis established, genes transferred, became permanent.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Discuss why the serial endosymbiosis theory proposes that mitochondria were acquired before chloroplasts, and explain the evidence supporting this sequence.","Serial endosymbiosis theory proposes that endosymbiotic events occurred in sequence, with mitochondria acquired first, then chloroplasts. Evidence and reasoning: (1) Distribution: ALL eukaryotes have mitochondria (or highly reduced versions), but only plants and algae have chloroplasts. If chloroplasts came first, we'd expect some eukaryotes to have chloroplasts but not mitochondria - but this doesn't exist. The universal distribution of mitochondria suggests they were acquired by the common ancestor of all eukaryotes, while chloroplasts were acquired later by only some lineages. (2) Energy requirements for phagocytosis: Engulfing large bacteria through phagocytosis requires significant energy (ATP). Aerobic respiration in mitochondria provides much more ATP than anaerobic fermentation. Therefore, having mitochondria first would have provided the energy needed to engulf cyanobacteria to form chloroplasts. An anaerobic cell would have difficulty generating enough ATP for multiple endosymbiotic events. (3) Complexity of hosts: Cells with mitochondria would be larger and more energetically capable, making them better hosts for additional endosymbionts. The extra ATP from mitochondria enabled cells to maintain larger size and more complex structures, which would facilitate harboring chloroplasts. (4) Secondary endosymbiosis: Some algae (like euglenids and chlorarachniophytes) have chloroplasts with three or four membranes, indicating they acquired chloroplasts by engulfing other eukaryotic algae that already had chloroplasts. This secondary endosymbiosis could only occur in cells that already had mitochondria and the capability for phagocytosis. (5) Evolutionary timeline: The Great Oxygenation Event ($2.4$ billion years ago) made oxygen available, enabling aerobic respiration. Eukaryotes with mitochondria appeared around $1.5$-$2$ billion years ago. Photosynthetic eukaryotes (with chloroplasts) appeared somewhat later, consistent with chloroplasts being acquired after mitochondria. The serial nature explains the diversity of eukaryotes: those that acquired only mitochondria (animals, fungi) versus those that acquired both mitochondria and chloroplasts (plants, algae).",Hard,"Serial endosymbiosis demonstrates that evolution can build complexity through multiple independent symbiotic events over time. The sequence matters because each event created new capabilities that enabled subsequent events. Mitochondria provided the energy that made chloroplast acquisition feasible, illustrating how evolutionary innovations build upon each other.","Explain universal distribution of mitochondria vs. limited chloroplasts, energy requirements, and timeline evidence.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Explain the significance of ribozymes (catalytic RNA molecules) in supporting the RNA world hypothesis.","Ribozymes are RNA molecules that can catalyze chemical reactions, acting like enzymes but made of RNA instead of protein. Their discovery is crucial evidence for the RNA world hypothesis: (1) Dual function capability: Ribozymes demonstrate that RNA can both store genetic information (like DNA) and catalyze reactions (like protein enzymes). This dual capability means early life could have functioned with RNA alone, before the evolution of specialized DNA and proteins. This solves the "chicken and egg" problem - which came first, genes (information) or enzymes (catalysis)? If RNA can do both, it could have come first. (2) Self-replication possibility: Some ribozymes can catalyze reactions involved in RNA synthesis. This raises the possibility of self-replicating RNA systems - RNA molecules that catalyze their own replication. Such self-replicating systems could have been the first step toward life. (3) Modern biological examples: Ribozymes exist in modern cells, suggesting RNA catalysis is not just theoretical but actually occurs: The ribosome uses RNA (rRNA) to catalyze peptide bond formation during protein synthesis. This means even today, one of life's most fundamental reactions is RNA-catalyzed, not protein-catalyzed. Self-splicing introns can remove themselves from RNA without protein enzymes. RNase P (which processes tRNA) has a catalytic RNA component. (4) Evolutionary relic: The presence of ribozymes in modern life suggests RNA catalysis is ancestral - a remnant of the RNA world that persists because it works well. Modern cells using RNA for catalysis in key processes (like translation) supports the idea that RNA came before proteins. The RNA world hypothesis sequence: Simple organic molecules → RNA molecules → Ribozymes (self-catalyzing RNA) → Self-replicating RNA systems → RNA-based proto-cells → Evolution of DNA (more stable information storage) and proteins (more diverse catalysis) → Modern cells. Ribozymes are the key evidence that this transition was chemically possible.",Hard,"Ribozymes transform the RNA world hypothesis from speculation into a testable scientific hypothesis by demonstrating that RNA catalysis is not only possible but actually occurs in modern biology.

It has a large internal space (lumen) separate from the cytoplasm. Function: The RER synthesizes proteins destined for secretion, membrane insertion, or organelles. Ribosomes on the RER translate mRNA, and the growing polypeptide chain is threaded into the RER lumen where it folds and may be modified (e.g., glycosylation - adding carbohydrate groups).

Vesicles fuse with the cis face (receiving side) of the Golgi. (2) Golgi processing: The Golgi has multiple stacked compartments (cisternae). As proteins move from cis to trans side, they are further modified: additional glycosylation, phosphorylation, proteolytic cleavage, etc. Different enzymes in each Golgi compartment perform specific modifications.

The inner membrane is highly impermeable and contains the proteins of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. This creates two compartments - the intermembrane space and the matrix - enabling the chemiosmotic gradient necessary for ATP synthesis. (2) Cristae (folded inner membrane): The inner membrane is extensively folded into cristae, dramatically increasing surface area. More surface area means more electron transport chains and ATP synthase molecules can be embedded, increasing ATP production capacity. Cells with high energy demands have mitochondria with more cristae. (3) Matrix: The interior space contains enzymes for the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), mitochondrial DNA, and ribosomes. The Krebs cycle generates $\\ce{NADH}$ and $\\ce{FADH2}$, which donate electrons to the electron transport chain. Having these enzymes concentrated in the matrix increases reaction efficiency. (4) Intermembrane space: The narrow space between outer and inner membranes can accumulate high concentrations of protons ($\\ce{H+}$) pumped from the matrix.

By separating different processes in membrane-bound organelles, eukaryotic cells can: (1) Run incompatible reactions simultaneously (e.g., synthesis in ER, degradation in lysosomes); (2) Create optimal conditions for specific reactions (e.g., low pH in lysosomes, high $\\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ in ER); (3) Concentrate enzymes and substrates to increase reaction efficiency; (4) Regulate processes by controlling what enters each compartment; (5) Protect the cell from harmful intermediates. This complexity allows eukaryotes to perform more sophisticated metabolism and regulation than prokaryotes.","Think about why it's useful to separate different chemical processes.","1. Eukaryotes have membrane-bound organelles\n2. Creates separate compartments\n3. Each with different conditions\n4. Allows simultaneous but incompatible reactions\n5.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Ultrastructure,MCQ,"Centrioles are structures found in most animal cells but not in plant cells. What is their primary function?","[""A) Photosynthesis"", ""B) Organizing microtubules, particularly during cell division"", ""C) Digesting cellular waste"", ""D) Storing water""]",B,Medium,"Centrioles are cylindrical structures composed of microtubules, arranged in a $9 + 0$ pattern (nine triplets, nothing in center). They function in organizing the microtubule network, particularly in forming the spindle apparatus during cell division. Centrioles are found at each pole of the dividing cell. Animal cells typically have a pair of centrioles (called a centrosome) that help organize spindle fibers. Plant cells lack centrioles but can still form spindles using other microtubule organizing centers. Centrioles are also involved in forming cilia and flagella in cells that have them.","These structures help organize the spindle during mitosis in animal cells.","1. Centrioles found in animal cells\n2. Not in plant cells\n3. Made of microtubules\n4. Organize spindle fibers during division\n5. Found at spindle poles\n6. Help separate chromosomes\n7. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Ultrastructure,FillBlank,"The large, membrane-bound sac in plant cells that stores water, maintains turgor pressure, and contains cell sap is called the ___.",vacuole,Easy,"The central vacuole in plant cells can occupy up to $90\\%$ of the cell volume. It stores water, ions, nutrients, and waste products in cell sap. Functions include: maintaining turgor pressure (water pressure against cell wall that keeps plants rigid), storing nutrients and waste products, regulating cell pH, and containing pigments (like anthocyanins that color flowers). Animal cells may have small vacuoles for storage or digestion, but these are much smaller than plant central vacuoles. The large central vacuole is a distinguishing feature of mature plant cells.","This large sac in plant cells stores water and maintains cell rigidity.","1. Plant cells have large internal sac\n2.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Ultrastructure,FillBlank,"In prokaryotic cells, small circular DNA molecules separate from the main chromosome that often carry genes for antibiotic resistance are called ___.",plasmids,Medium,"Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that can replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome. They typically carry genes that provide selective advantages: antibiotic resistance, toxin production, or ability to metabolize unusual nutrients. Plasmids can be transferred between bacteria through conjugation, which spreads traits like antibiotic resistance rapidly through bacterial populations. This is a major mechanism of horizontal gene transfer. Plasmids are widely used in biotechnology as vectors for genetic engineering. Some eukaryotic cells (like yeast) also have plasmids, but they're most common and important in bacteria.","These small DNA circles in bacteria often carry antibiotic resistance genes.","1. Bacteria have main circular chromosome\n2. Also have small extra DNA circles\n3. Replicate independently\n4. Often carry antibiotic resistance\n5. Can transfer between bacteria\n6.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Ultrastructure,FreeResponse,"Explain why prokaryotic cells can function efficiently without membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells require them.","Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have fundamentally different strategies for cellular organization: Prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) function efficiently without membrane-bound organelles because: (1) Small size: Prokaryotes are typically $1$-$10 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$, giving them a very high surface area to volume ratio. This means every point inside the cell is close to the membrane, allowing rapid diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and oxygen. Distance from membrane to center is never more than a few micrometers. (2) Simple metabolism: While prokaryotes have diverse metabolisms, individual cells typically don't need to run many incompatible processes simultaneously. They can use the plasma membrane for processes eukaryotes do in organelle membranes (like the electron transport chain occurs in the plasma membrane, not in mitochondria). (3) Rapid reproduction: Small size and simple organization allow rapid cell division (some bacteria divide every $20$ minutes). This compensates for limited individual cell complexity through rapid population growth. (4) Minimal internal transport needed: Because diffusion is adequate for small distances, prokaryotes don't need active internal transport systems or motor proteins to move materials around. Eukaryotic cells require membrane-bound organelles because: (1) Larger size: At $10$-$100 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$, eukaryotic cells have much lower surface area to volume ratios. Diffusion alone would be too slow to supply the interior. Compartmentalization brings membrane surfaces throughout the cell's volume. (2) Complex, incompatible processes: Eukaryotes need to perform many processes that would interfere with each other: synthesis (ER) and degradation (lysosomes), aerobic respiration (mitochondria) requiring oxygen while other processes are oxygen-sensitive, photosynthesis (chloroplasts) producing oxygen while respiration consumes it. Separate compartments allow these processes simultaneously. (3) Specialization: Different organelles can optimize conditions (pH, ion concentrations, enzymes) for specific processes. Lysosomes maintain pH ~$5$, while cytoplasm is ~$7$. This isn't possible without membranes separating compartments. (4) Concentration of molecules: Organelles concentrate enzymes and substrates, increasing reaction efficiency. Evolution of compartmentalization: The evolution of membrane-bound organelles (possibly through endosymbiosis and membrane invagination) was key to eukaryotic complexity, enabling larger cell size and more sophisticated metabolism. Different strategies, both successful: Prokaryotes succeed through simplicity, small size, and rapid reproduction. Eukaryotes succeed through complexity, compartmentalization, and specialization. Each strategy thrives in different ecological niches.",Hard,"The prokaryote-eukaryote distinction illustrates a fundamental principle: there are multiple successful solutions to life's challenges. Prokaryotes optimize for simplicity and efficiency at small scales, while eukaryotes use compartmentalization to achieve complexity at larger scales. Neither is 'better' - each succeeds magnificently in its own way.","Explain prokaryote advantages (small size, high SA:V, simple) vs. eukaryote needs (large size, complex processes, compartmentalization).","1. Prokaryotes: small ($1$-$10 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$)\n2. High SA:V ratio\n3. Diffusion adequate for whole cell\n4. Simple organization sufficient\n5. Use membrane for metabolism\n6.
