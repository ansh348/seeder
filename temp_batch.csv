IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"Explain how the lac operon demonstrates gene regulation in response to environmental changes. Include the roles of the repressor protein, operator, and lactose in your answer.","The lac operon is a classic example of inducible gene regulation in bacteria. When lactose is absent from the environment, the lac repressor protein binds to the operator sequence, which is located near the promoter. This blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes needed to digest lactose, conserving cellular resources. When lactose becomes available, it binds to the repressor protein, causing a conformational change that makes the repressor release from the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to access the promoter and transcribe the lac genes, producing enzymes that digest lactose. This system allows bacteria to produce lactose-digesting enzymes only when lactose is present, demonstrating efficient adaptation to environmental changes.",Medium,"The lac operon exemplifies how cells respond to their environment through gene regulation.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"Describe the difference between how steroid hormones and protein hormones affect gene expression in target cells.","Steroid hormones and protein hormones affect gene expression through different mechanisms due to their chemical properties. Steroid hormones are lipid-soluble, allowing them to pass directly through the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus. The hormone-receptor complex then acts as a transcription factor, entering the nucleus and binding directly to DNA to regulate gene transcription. In contrast, protein hormones are not lipid-soluble and cannot cross the cell membrane. Instead, they bind to receptors on the cell surface, which triggers intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways ultimately affect transcription factors in the nucleus, but the hormone itself never enters the cell. Both mechanisms result in changes to gene expression, but they follow different routes based on the hormone's chemical nature.",Hard,"The key difference lies in membrane permeability. Steroid hormones can cross membranes and directly interact with intracellular receptors that function as transcription factors, while protein hormones work through cell surface receptors and signaling cascades.","Consider the chemical properties of steroids (lipids) versus proteins and how this affects their ability to cross membranes.","1. Describe steroid hormone mechanism (crosses membrane, binds internal receptor, acts as transcription factor)\n2.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"Explain why gene regulation is more efficient than constitutive (constant) expression of all genes in an organism.","Gene regulation is far more efficient than constitutive expression for several important reasons. First, it conserves cellular resources and energy. Producing proteins requires significant amounts of ATP and amino acids, so making only needed proteins prevents waste. Second, gene regulation allows cells to respond appropriately to environmental changes by producing the right proteins at the right time. For example, digestive enzymes are only made when their substrate is available. Third, differential gene expression allows cell specialization - muscle cells express muscle-specific genes while nerve cells express different genes, even though both contain the same DNA. Fourth, inappropriate expression of some genes could be harmful; for instance, expressing cell division genes at the wrong time could lead to cancer. By regulating gene expression, organisms can maintain thousands of different cell types, respond to environmental challenges, conserve resources, and prevent harmful effects of inappropriate protein production.",Hard,"Gene regulation provides flexibility, efficiency, and control. Consider the costs of making proteins unnecessarily, the need for cells to respond to changes, and the importance of different cell types having different functions despite having identical DNA.","Think about what would happen if a cell made every possible protein all the time.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"A researcher discovers a mutant bacterium in which the lac operon genes are continuously expressed even in the absence of lactose. Suggest two possible mutations that could cause this phenotype and explain your reasoning.","Two possible mutations could cause continuous expression of the lac operon. First, there could be a mutation in the operator sequence that prevents the repressor protein from binding. If the repressor cannot bind to the operator, it cannot block RNA polymerase, so transcription would occur continuously regardless of lactose presence. The operator would lose its regulatory function. Second, there could be a mutation in the gene that codes for the repressor protein itself, either preventing its production or altering its structure so it cannot bind to the operator. Without functional repressor protein, nothing would block transcription of the lac genes. Both mutations would result in the same phenotype - constitutive expression - but through different molecular mechanisms. A third possibility (though less common) would be a mutation affecting the repressor's ability to bind to the operator after binding lactose, essentially making it permanently inactive.",Hard,"Consider the components needed for repression to work: the operator sequence must be correct, and the repressor protein must be functional. A defect in either would prevent repression.","Think about what normally keeps the lac genes off when lactose is absent, and what could go wrong with that system.","1. Identify that continuous expression means repression isn't working\n2. Suggest mutation in operator (repressor can't bind)\n3. Explain the effect (no blocking of transcription)\n4. Suggest mutation in repressor gene (no functional repressor made)\n5. Explain the effect (nothing to block transcription)\n6. Note that both lead to same phenotype"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"Explain the role of transcription factors in linking cell signaling to gene expression. Use an example to support your answer.","Transcription factors serve as the critical link between cell signaling pathways and gene expression changes. They are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences to control whether genes are transcribed into mRNA. External signals activate intracellular pathways that regulate transcription factors, either by activating inactive factors, causing their movement into the nucleus, or modifying their activity. For example, when insulin binds to its receptor on a cell, it activates a signaling pathway that affects transcription factors controlling genes involved in glucose metabolism and cell growth. These transcription factors then enter the nucleus and increase expression of genes needed for glucose uptake and storage. Another example is how steroid hormones like estrogen activate intracellular receptors that act directly as transcription factors. The hormone-receptor complex enters the nucleus and binds to DNA, regulating genes involved in reproductive development. Without transcription factors, there would be no way for extracellular signals to produce specific changes in gene expression.",Hard,"Transcription factors are the molecular bridges between signaling and gene expression. Signals modify transcription factor activity, location, or abundance, which then changes which genes are expressed.","Consider the path: external signal → receptor → pathway → transcription factor → gene expression change.","1. Define transcription factors and their basic function\n2. Explain how signals affect transcription factors\n3. Provide a specific example (insulin, steroid hormones, or growth factors)\n4. Describe the pathway from signal to gene expression\n5. Explain the significance of this link"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"Compare positive and negative regulation of gene expression, providing one example of each.","Positive and negative regulation represent two fundamental strategies for controlling gene expression. Negative regulation involves mechanisms that reduce or prevent gene transcription. The classic example is the lac operon, where the lac repressor protein binds to the operator and blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the lac genes when lactose is absent. The genes are turned off unless the repressor is inactivated by lactose. In contrast, positive regulation involves mechanisms that enhance or promote gene transcription. An example is the CAP-cAMP system in bacteria, where the CAP protein, when bound to cAMP, binds near the promoter and helps RNA polymerase bind more efficiently, increasing transcription of certain genes. Many genes are controlled by both positive and negative regulation, allowing fine-tuned control. Negative regulation is often used to prevent unnecessary gene expression (saving resources), while positive regulation is used to boost expression when products are urgently needed. Together, these mechanisms give cells precise control over gene expression levels.",Hard,"Negative regulation turns genes off or keeps them off, while positive regulation turns genes on or enhances their expression. Both are important for different cellular needs.","Think about the lac repressor (blocks expression) versus activator proteins (enhance expression).","1. Define negative regulation with example (lac repressor)\n2. Explain mechanism and purpose\n3. Define positive regulation with example (CAP-cAMP or activators)\n4. Explain mechanism and purpose\n5. Compare the two strategies and their advantages\n6. Note that many genes use both types"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Gene Regulation via Signalling,FreeResponse,"Describe how gene regulation allows different cell types in a multicellular organism to have different structures and functions despite having identical DNA.","All cells in a multicellular organism contain the same DNA, yet they can have vastly different structures and functions due to differential gene expression through gene regulation. Each cell type expresses only a subset of genes appropriate for its function while keeping other genes turned off. For example, muscle cells express genes for actin and myosin proteins needed for contraction, while these genes remain off in nerve cells. Conversely, nerve cells express genes for neurotransmitter production and ion channels, which are not expressed in muscle cells. This selective gene expression is controlled by transcription factors that are specific to each cell type. During development, cells receive different signals based on their position in the embryo, leading to activation of different sets of transcription factors. These transcription factors then activate tissue-specific genes while repressing others. Once established, these expression patterns are often maintained through cell divisions, creating stable cell types. This mechanism allows a single genome to produce hundreds of different cell types, each specialized for specific functions, enabling the complexity of multicellular life.",Hard,"The key concept is differential gene expression - same DNA, different genes expressed. Cell-specific transcription factors determine which genes are on or off in each cell type.","Consider muscle cells versus nerve cells - same DNA, but very different proteins being made.","1. State that all cells have identical DNA\n2. Explain that different genes are expressed in different cell types\n3. Provide specific examples (muscle vs. nerve cells)\n4. Explain the role of transcription factors in cell-specific expression\n5. Describe how these patterns are established during development\n6. Conclude with the significance for multicellular life"

Each receptor has a uniquely shaped binding site that fits only certain signaling molecules with complementary shapes, similar to the lock-and-key model used for enzymes. For example, an insulin receptor can only bind insulin because its binding site matches insulin's three-dimensional structure. It cannot bind adrenaline or other hormones because their shapes don't fit. This specificity is essential for accurate cellular communication - it ensures that cells respond only to appropriate signals and can distinguish between many different signals in their environment. Without this specificity, cells would respond incorrectly to signals, leading to inappropriate cellular responses. Different receptors allow cells to detect multiple different signals simultaneously and coordinate complex responses based on the combination of signals received.",Medium,"Receptor-ligand specificity is like a lock-and-key relationship - each receptor (lock) fits only certain ligands (keys).

Cell surface receptors are located in the plasma membrane with part of the protein exposed to the outside of the cell. They bind water-soluble or large signaling molecules such as protein hormones (insulin, growth factors), peptide hormones, and neurotransmitters. These molecules cannot cross the lipid bilayer due to their size or polar nature, so they must bind to surface receptors. In contrast, intracellular receptors are located inside the cell, either in the cytoplasm or nucleus. They bind small, lipid-soluble signaling molecules such as steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen, cortisol) and thyroid hormones.

This shape change is crucial because it activates the receptor, allowing it to interact with other molecules inside the cell. The activated receptor can then trigger a series of molecular events inside the cell, starting a signaling cascade that ultimately produces a cellular response. This binding event is the first step in cell signaling because it converts an extracellular signal into an intracellular signal - a process called signal transduction. Without this initial binding and activation, the cell would not be able to detect the signal or respond to it. The specificity of receptor-ligand binding ensures that cells respond only to appropriate signals. After the response is complete, the ligand can dissociate from the receptor, returning it to its inactive state and allowing the signal to be terminated.",Hard,"Ligand binding causes receptor activation through a conformational change, which initiates intracellular signaling cascades.

Predict the effects this would have on blood glucose regulation and explain your reasoning.","If insulin receptors do not function properly, the patient would be unable to respond normally to insulin, even if insulin is present in the bloodstream. This would lead to several serious effects on blood glucose regulation. First, cells would not increase their glucose uptake in response to insulin, so glucose would remain in the blood rather than entering cells. This would cause persistently high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia), especially after meals. Second, the liver would not respond to insulin's signal to stop glucose production and start glucose storage as glycogen. This would worsen the hyperglycemia. Third, muscle and fat cells would not take up glucose for storage or energy use, leading to cellular energy deficiency despite high blood glucose. Over time, this would cause symptoms similar to Type 2 diabetes, including excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and potential damage to organs from chronic high blood sugar. This condition demonstrates the critical importance of functional receptors for normal cell signaling and metabolism. Even with normal insulin production, defective receptors prevent the signal from being received, showing that both the signal and the receptor must be functional for proper cellular communication.",Hard,"Non-functional insulin receptors mean cells cannot detect insulin, even if it's present.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Receptors: GPCRs & RTKs,FreeResponse,"Explain why receptor-ligand binding is reversible and discuss the functional importance of this reversibility for cell signaling.","Receptor-ligand binding is reversible because it relies on weak, non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and van der Waals forces rather than strong covalent bonds. These weak interactions allow the ligand to bind when its concentration is high and dissociate when its concentration decreases. The reversibility of receptor-ligand binding is functionally important for several reasons. First, it allows receptors to be reused - after a ligand dissociates, the receptor returns to its inactive state and can bind another ligand molecule. This means cells don't need to constantly produce new receptors. Second, reversibility enables signal termination. When the signaling molecule is removed or degraded, ligands dissociate from receptors, and the cellular response stops. This prevents continuous, uncontrolled signaling. Third, reversible binding allows cells to respond dynamically to changing signal concentrations. When signal levels are high, more receptors are occupied and the response is stronger; when levels drop, fewer receptors are occupied and the response decreases. This provides graded, proportional responses rather than all-or-nothing responses. Finally, reversibility allows rapid adjustment to environmental changes - cells can quickly turn signals on and off as needed.",Hard,"Reversible binding uses weak interactions that can form and break easily. This allows receptors to be reused, enables signal termination, and permits dynamic responses to changing signal levels.","Consider what would happen if receptor-ligand binding were permanent and irreversible.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Receptors: GPCRs & RTKs,FreeResponse,"Explain how the presence or absence of specific receptors determines which signals a cell can respond to. Use an example to support your answer.","A cell can only respond to signals for which it has appropriate receptors. The presence or absence of specific receptors determines the cell's sensitivity to different signaling molecules, even if those molecules are present in the environment. This is because signal reception requires physical binding between the signaling molecule and its receptor - without the receptor, the signal cannot be detected or transduced. For example, liver cells have receptors for insulin, glucagon, and adrenaline, allowing them to respond to all three hormones and regulate glucose metabolism accordingly. When insulin binds to its receptors on liver cells, it triggers glucose storage. In contrast, red blood cells do not have these hormone receptors because they don't regulate glucose metabolism in the same way - they take up glucose constitutively without hormone regulation. Another example is nerve cells having receptors for neurotransmitters like acetylcholine or dopamine, while muscle cells may not have dopamine receptors. This selective receptor expression allows different cell types to respond to different combinations of signals, enabling specialized functions. It also explains why the same signaling molecule can be present throughout the body but only affects certain cell types - only cells with the appropriate receptors will respond.",Hard,"Cells need receptors to detect signals - no receptor means no response, regardless of whether the signal is present.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Communication & Signal Transduction (HL),Receptors: GPCRs & RTKs,FreeResponse,"Describe how the structure of cell surface receptors enables them to transmit signals from outside the cell to the inside, even though the signaling molecule never enters the cell.","Cell surface receptors are transmembrane proteins with three main regions that enable signal transmission across the membrane. The extracellular domain (outside the cell) contains the ligand-binding site where the signaling molecule attaches. The transmembrane domain spans the lipid bilayer, anchoring the receptor in the membrane. The intracellular domain (inside the cell) is responsible for transmitting the signal to other molecules within the cell. When a signaling molecule binds to the extracellular domain, it causes a conformational change that extends through the transmembrane region to the intracellular domain. This change in the intracellular domain's shape allows it to interact with other proteins inside the cell, such as enzymes or signaling molecules, initiating a cascade of events. This mechanism is called signal transduction - the conversion of one type of signal (extracellular ligand binding) into another (intracellular molecular activation). The beauty of this system is that large or polar signaling molecules that cannot cross the membrane can still influence intracellular processes. The receptor acts as a molecular bridge, converting the external signal into an internal response without requiring the signaling molecule to enter the cell.",Hard,"Receptors span the membrane with parts both outside and inside the cell. Ligand binding outside causes a conformational change that activates the inside portion, transmitting the signal across the membrane without the ligand entering.","Think about how information could be transmitted through a membrane without the signal molecule crossing it.","1.
