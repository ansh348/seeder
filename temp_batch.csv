The inner membrane is the original plasma membrane of the bacterium, while the outer membrane came from the host cell's membrane that formed the engulfing vesicle. This double membrane structure is key evidence for endosymbiosis. The two membranes have different compositions: the inner membrane resembles bacterial membranes (with proteins for electron transport), while the outer membrane is more similar to eukaryotic membranes.","Think about what happens when a cell engulfs something by endocytosis.","1.

Before this, Earth's atmosphere was essentially oxygen-free. The accumulation of $\\ce{O2}$ was initially toxic to many anaerobic organisms but eventually enabled the evolution of aerobic respiration and complex multicellular life.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Describe three pieces of evidence that support the endosymbiotic theory for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.","The endosymbiotic theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) Own DNA: Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own circular DNA molecules, similar in structure to bacterial chromosomes rather than linear eukaryotic chromosomes. This DNA encodes some (but not all) of the proteins these organelles need, suggesting they were once independent but have become dependent on the host cell over evolutionary time. (2) Own ribosomes: These organelles have $70$S ribosomes, identical to bacterial ribosomes, not the $80$S ribosomes found in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. These ribosomes are also sensitive to antibiotics that specifically target bacterial protein synthesis (like chloramphenicol), but not to antibiotics that target eukaryotic ribosomes. (3) Binary fission: Mitochondria and chloroplasts reproduce by binary fission (splitting in two), the same process bacteria use to divide, and they do this independently of the cell cycle. They cannot be created de novo - new mitochondria and chloroplasts only arise from pre-existing ones, just like bacteria. Additional evidence: (4) Double membrane with different compositions - inner membrane resembles bacterial membranes while outer resembles eukaryotic membranes; (5) Size similar to bacteria; (6) DNA sequence analysis shows mitochondria are most closely related to alpha-proteobacteria and chloroplasts to cyanobacteria. Together, this evidence strongly supports that these organelles descended from free-living bacteria that established endosymbiotic relationships with early eukaryotic cells.",Medium,"The evidence for endosymbiotic theory is compelling because it comes from multiple independent sources - genetics (DNA structure), biochemistry (ribosome type), cell biology (division mechanism), and molecular phylogenetics (DNA sequences). Each piece alone is suggestive, but together they create an overwhelming case for the bacterial origin of these organelles.","Structure answer around three main evidence types: DNA characteristics, ribosome type, and reproduction method.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Explain why the evolution of photosynthesis was crucial for the later evolution of complex life, including eukaryotes.","The evolution of photosynthesis, particularly oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, was transformative for Earth and essential for complex life: (1) Oxygen production: Photosynthetic organisms, especially cyanobacteria, released $\\ce{O2}$ as a waste product. Over hundreds of millions of years, this oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, changing it from anaerobic to aerobic (Great Oxygenation Event, ~$2.4$ billion years ago). (2) Enabled aerobic respiration: The accumulation of atmospheric $\\ce{O2}$ made aerobic respiration possible. Aerobic respiration produces far more ATP per glucose molecule (~$32$-$38$ ATP) compared to anaerobic fermentation (~$2$ ATP). This dramatic increase in energy availability enabled the evolution of larger, more complex organisms with higher energy demands. (3) Formation of ozone layer: Atmospheric oxygen led to the formation of the ozone ($\\ce{O3}$) layer in the upper atmosphere, which blocks harmful UV radiation. This made it possible for life to eventually colonize land surfaces. (4) Enabled endosymbiosis: The presence of aerobic bacteria (which evolved to use oxygen for respiration) created the opportunity for endosymbiosis. Early eukaryotic cells could engulf these aerobic bacteria, which became mitochondria, providing the host cell with efficient ATP production. (5) Energy for complexity: The high energy yield from aerobic respiration in mitochondria provided the power necessary for eukaryotic cells to maintain complex internal structures (nucleus, endomembrane system), active transport, and large cell size. Without photosynthesis, Earth would have remained an anaerobic world populated only by simple prokaryotes. Photosynthesis provided both the energy (through food webs) and the oxygen (for respiration) necessary for the evolution of eukaryotes, multicellular organisms, and eventually all complex life including animals and plants.",Hard,"Photosynthesis represents one of evolution's most significant innovations because it transformed not just individual organisms but the entire planetary environment. By producing oxygen, it created both a new energy source (aerobic respiration) and enabled endosymbiosis, setting the stage for the evolution of all complex life. This demonstrates how biological innovation can fundamentally alter evolutionary possibilities.","Explain oxygen production, how oxygen enabled aerobic respiration, and how this high energy enabled complex life and eukaryotes.","1. Photosynthesis evolved in cyanobacteria\n2. Produced $\\ce{O2}$ as waste\n3. Oxygen accumulated in atmosphere (GOE)\n4. Changed Earth from anaerobic to aerobic\n5.

The nucleus is thought to have evolved through invagination of the plasma membrane, not through endosymbiosis. Evidence FOR endosymbiotic theory includes: DNA sequence similarities between organelles and specific bacterial groups, binary fission reproduction, double membranes, own ribosomes, and circular DNA.

This process of gene transfer has created dependence - mitochondria and chloroplasts can no longer survive independently because they need proteins encoded by nuclear genes. Mitochondrial DNA in humans encodes only $13$ proteins, while mitochondria need over $1000$ proteins to function. The rest are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and imported into mitochondria. This gene transfer likely occurred because nuclear DNA has better repair mechanisms and is less exposed to reactive oxygen species than organellar DNA.","Think about the evolutionary relationship and gene transfer between organelles and nucleus.","1.

Aerobic bacteria could use oxygen to break down glucose completely, generating much more ATP (~$32$-$38$ per glucose) than anaerobic fermentation (~$2$ ATP per glucose). This energy advantage allowed eukaryotic cells to grow larger, maintain complex internal structures, and evolve new capabilities. The aerobic bacterium gained protection and nutrients from the host. This mutual benefit made the relationship stable over evolutionary time.","Consider what aerobic bacteria can do that anaerobic cells cannot.","1. Aerobic bacteria use oxygen for respiration\n2.

RNA can both store genetic information (like DNA) and catalyze reactions (like enzymes). RNA molecules with catalytic activity are called ribozymes. This hypothesis helps explain the origin of life by showing how a single molecule type could fulfill multiple functions before the evolution of specialized DNA (for information storage) and proteins (for catalysis). Evidence includes the discovery of ribozymes and the fact that ribosomes use RNA to catalyze peptide bond formation.","This hypothesis suggests RNA came before DNA and proteins in evolution.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FillBlank,"The primitive soup of organic molecules that may have existed on early Earth, from which life could have originated, is often called the primordial ___.",soup,Easy,"The primordial soup (or prebiotic soup) refers to the hypothetical mixture of organic compounds that accumulated in Earth's early oceans. These organic molecules - amino acids, nucleotides, sugars, and lipids - could have formed through abiotic synthesis (chemical reactions without life). Experiments like Miller-Urey (1953) showed that organic molecules can form from inorganic precursors under conditions simulating early Earth. From this primordial soup, increasingly complex molecules could have formed, eventually leading to self-replicating systems and the first cells.","This term describes the mixture of organic molecules in Earth's early oceans.","1.

DNA sequence analysis shows chloroplasts are most closely related to cyanobacteria. When an early eukaryotic cell (possibly one that already had mitochondria) engulfed a cyanobacterium, it gained the ability to photosynthesize. This explains why only some eukaryotes (plants and algae) have chloroplasts, while all eukaryotes have mitochondria - chloroplast endosymbiosis occurred later and in fewer lineages.","These photosynthetic bacteria are blue-green and still exist today.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FillBlank,"The process by which a cell membrane surrounds and engulfs an external particle, bringing it into the cell, is called ___.",endocytosis,Medium,"Endocytosis is the process by which cells engulf external materials by wrapping them in a portion of the cell membrane, forming a vesicle. This is how endosymbiosis likely occurred - a primitive eukaryotic cell engulfed an aerobic bacterium through endocytosis, but instead of digesting it, established a symbiotic relationship. Types of endocytosis include phagocytosis (engulfing particles) and pinocytosis (engulfing liquids). The engulfing of bacteria to form mitochondria and chloroplasts was probably phagocytosis.","This process wraps external materials in membrane to bring them inside the cell.","1. Cells can take in external materials\n2. Membrane surrounds material\n3. Forms vesicle inside cell\n4. This process is endocytosis\n5. Likely mechanism for endosymbiosis\n6. Answer: endocytosis"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Explain the sequence of events in endosymbiotic theory, describing how mitochondria became established in eukaryotic cells.","The endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria occurred through this sequence: (1) Initial state: Early eukaryotic ancestor existed, possibly anaerobic, with a nucleus and flexible cell membrane but no mitochondria. The cell could perform endocytosis. Meanwhile, aerobic bacteria evolved that could use oxygen for efficient respiration. (2) Engulfment: The ancestral eukaryotic cell engulfed an aerobic bacterium through endocytosis (phagocytosis). The bacterium was surrounded by a membrane vesicle derived from the host cell's membrane. (3) Avoidance of digestion: Instead of being digested by lysosomes (as would normally happen), the bacterium survived inside the host cell. This may have occurred due to beneficial molecules the bacterium produced, or resistance to the host's digestive enzymes. (4) Establishment of symbiosis: The bacterium produced ATP efficiently through aerobic respiration and shared this ATP with the host cell, providing an energy advantage. The host cell provided the bacterium with protection and nutrients (glucose, oxygen). This mutualistic relationship benefited both partners. (5) Gene transfer and integration: Over evolutionary time, many bacterial genes were transferred to the host nucleus. The bacterium became dependent on nuclear genes and could no longer survive independently. The host became dependent on the bacterium for efficient ATP production. (6) Vertical inheritance: The endosymbiont reproduced by binary fission inside the host and was passed to daughter cells during cell division. Over millions of years, this relationship became permanent, and the endosymbiont evolved into mitochondria. Result: All descendant eukaryotic cells inherited mitochondria, making them essential organelles that retain bacterial characteristics (own DNA, ribosomes, division mechanism) while being fully integrated into eukaryotic cell function.",Hard,"The endosymbiotic process demonstrates how cooperation between different organisms can drive major evolutionary transitions. What began as a chance engulfment event became a permanent partnership that enabled the evolution of complex eukaryotic life. The integration was so successful that mitochondria are now essential and inseparable from their host cells.","Describe the steps: ancestral cells exist, engulfment occurs, symbiosis established, genes transferred, became permanent.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Discuss why the serial endosymbiosis theory proposes that mitochondria were acquired before chloroplasts, and explain the evidence supporting this sequence.","Serial endosymbiosis theory proposes that endosymbiotic events occurred in sequence, with mitochondria acquired first, then chloroplasts. Evidence and reasoning: (1) Distribution: ALL eukaryotes have mitochondria (or highly reduced versions), but only plants and algae have chloroplasts. If chloroplasts came first, we'd expect some eukaryotes to have chloroplasts but not mitochondria - but this doesn't exist. The universal distribution of mitochondria suggests they were acquired by the common ancestor of all eukaryotes, while chloroplasts were acquired later by only some lineages. (2) Energy requirements for phagocytosis: Engulfing large bacteria through phagocytosis requires significant energy (ATP). Aerobic respiration in mitochondria provides much more ATP than anaerobic fermentation. Therefore, having mitochondria first would have provided the energy needed to engulf cyanobacteria to form chloroplasts. An anaerobic cell would have difficulty generating enough ATP for multiple endosymbiotic events. (3) Complexity of hosts: Cells with mitochondria would be larger and more energetically capable, making them better hosts for additional endosymbionts. The extra ATP from mitochondria enabled cells to maintain larger size and more complex structures, which would facilitate harboring chloroplasts. (4) Secondary endosymbiosis: Some algae (like euglenids and chlorarachniophytes) have chloroplasts with three or four membranes, indicating they acquired chloroplasts by engulfing other eukaryotic algae that already had chloroplasts. This secondary endosymbiosis could only occur in cells that already had mitochondria and the capability for phagocytosis. (5) Evolutionary timeline: The Great Oxygenation Event ($2.4$ billion years ago) made oxygen available, enabling aerobic respiration. Eukaryotes with mitochondria appeared around $1.5$-$2$ billion years ago. Photosynthetic eukaryotes (with chloroplasts) appeared somewhat later, consistent with chloroplasts being acquired after mitochondria. The serial nature explains the diversity of eukaryotes: those that acquired only mitochondria (animals, fungi) versus those that acquired both mitochondria and chloroplasts (plants, algae).",Hard,"Serial endosymbiosis demonstrates that evolution can build complexity through multiple independent symbiotic events over time. The sequence matters because each event created new capabilities that enabled subsequent events. Mitochondria provided the energy that made chloroplast acquisition feasible, illustrating how evolutionary innovations build upon each other.","Explain universal distribution of mitochondria vs. limited chloroplasts, energy requirements, and timeline evidence.","1.

Three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya\n2. Archaea are prokaryotic\n3. Often live in extreme environments\n4. Hot springs, very salty, anaerobic\n5. Distinct from bacteria\n6. Answer: archaea"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FillBlank,"The evolution of organisms that could use oxygen for respiration is described as the evolution of ___ respiration.",aerobic,Easy,"Aerobic respiration is the process of breaking down glucose using oxygen to produce ATP. After the Great Oxygenation Event made oxygen available in the atmosphere, organisms evolved that could use this oxygen for respiration. Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic processes, producing approximately $32$-$38$ ATP per glucose compared to only $2$ ATP from fermentation. The evolution of aerobic respiration was a major evolutionary innovation that enabled the later evolution of complex life.","This type of respiration uses oxygen and is much more efficient than fermentation.","1. Early organisms: anaerobic (no oxygen)\n2. After oxygen accumulated: new metabolism evolved\n3. Uses oxygen for cellular respiration\n4. Called aerobic respiration\n5. Much more ATP than anaerobic\n6. Answer: aerobic"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Origin of Cells & Endosymbiosis,FreeResponse,"Explain the significance of ribozymes (catalytic RNA molecules) in supporting the RNA world hypothesis.","Ribozymes are RNA molecules that can catalyze chemical reactions, acting like enzymes but made of RNA instead of protein. Their discovery is crucial evidence for the RNA world hypothesis: (1) Dual function capability: Ribozymes demonstrate that RNA can both store genetic information (like DNA) and catalyze reactions (like protein enzymes). This dual capability means early life could have functioned with RNA alone, before the evolution of specialized DNA and proteins. This solves the "chicken and egg" problem - which came first, genes (information) or enzymes (catalysis)? If RNA can do both, it could have come first. (2) Self-replication possibility: Some ribozymes can catalyze reactions involved in RNA synthesis. This raises the possibility of self-replicating RNA systems - RNA molecules that catalyze their own replication. Such self-replicating systems could have been the first step toward life. (3) Modern biological examples: Ribozymes exist in modern cells, suggesting RNA catalysis is not just theoretical but actually occurs: The ribosome uses RNA (rRNA) to catalyze peptide bond formation during protein synthesis. This means even today, one of life's most fundamental reactions is RNA-catalyzed, not protein-catalyzed. Self-splicing introns can remove themselves from RNA without protein enzymes. RNase P (which processes tRNA) has a catalytic RNA component. (4) Evolutionary relic: The presence of ribozymes in modern life suggests RNA catalysis is ancestral - a remnant of the RNA world that persists because it works well. Modern cells using RNA for catalysis in key processes (like translation) supports the idea that RNA came before proteins. The RNA world hypothesis sequence: Simple organic molecules → RNA molecules → Ribozymes (self-catalyzing RNA) → Self-replicating RNA systems → RNA-based proto-cells → Evolution of DNA (more stable information storage) and proteins (more diverse catalysis) → Modern cells. Ribozymes are the key evidence that this transition was chemically possible.",Hard,"Ribozymes transform the RNA world hypothesis from speculation into a testable scientific hypothesis by demonstrating that RNA catalysis is not only possible but actually occurs in modern biology. Their existence shows that RNA is capable of the dual role required for early life, making an RNA-based origin of life chemically plausible rather than merely hypothetical.","Explain that ribozymes show RNA can catalyze reactions, solving the gene-enzyme problem, and give examples from modern cells.","1. Problem: genes need enzymes, enzymes need genes\n2. Which evolved first?\n3. Ribozymes: RNA molecules that catalyze reactions\n4. RNA can both store information AND catalyze\n5.
