Gametes are sex cells (sperm and eggs)\n3. Their formation is called gametogenesis\n4. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,MCQ,"How many functional gametes are produced from one cell during spermatogenesis?","[""A) One"", ""B) Two"", ""C) Three"", ""D) Four""]",D,Medium,"During spermatogenesis, one diploid spermatocyte undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid spermatids, which then differentiate into four functional sperm cells. This is different from oogenesis, which produces only one functional egg.","Consider the products of meiosis and whether they all become functional in males.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,MCQ,"Why does oogenesis produce only one functional egg while spermatogenesis produces four functional sperm?","[""A) Female cells cannot divide as many times as male cells"", ""B) The cytoplasm is divided unequally in oogenesis to provide the egg with nutrients"", ""C) Oogenesis does not involve meiosis"", ""D) Female gametes do not need as many cells""]",B,Hard,"In oogenesis, meiosis produces four cells, but the cytoplasm is divided unequally. One cell (the egg or ovum) receives most of the cytoplasm and nutrients, while the other three cells (polar bodies) receive very little cytoplasm and eventually degenerate. This ensures the egg has sufficient nutrients and organelles to support early embryonic development.","Consider why an egg needs to be large and nutrient-rich while sperm need to be small and numerous.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,FreeResponse,"Explain the importance of meiosis in gametogenesis.","Meiosis is essential in gametogenesis for several important reasons. First, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from diploid ($2n$) to haploid ($n$), producing gametes with half the normal number of chromosomes. This is crucial because when sperm and egg fuse during fertilization, the diploid number is restored in the zygote. If gametes were diploid, the chromosome number would double with each generation, which is not viable. Second, meiosis introduces genetic variation through two mechanisms: crossing over (recombination) during prophase I, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, and independent assortment during metaphase I, where chromosomes are randomly distributed to daughter cells. This genetic variation is important for evolution and adaptation, as it produces genetically unique gametes and therefore unique offspring. Without meiosis, sexual reproduction would not maintain a constant chromosome number across generations, and offspring would be genetically identical to their parents, reducing the population's ability to adapt to changing environments.",Medium,"This answer explains both the chromosome number management and genetic variation roles of meiosis. Understanding why meiosis is necessary for sexual reproduction is fundamental to genetics and developmental biology.","Consider what would happen to chromosome numbers without meiosis, and why genetic variation matters.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,FreeResponse,"Describe the structural adaptations of sperm cells that enable them to successfully fertilize an egg.","Sperm cells have several specialized structural adaptations that enable successful fertilization. First, the head contains the nucleus with the haploid set of chromosomes tightly packed, and it is capped by the acrosome, which contains enzymes needed to digest through the egg's protective layers (zona pellucida). Second, the midpiece is packed with mitochondria that provide ATP to power the flagellum, ensuring the sperm has sufficient energy for the journey to the egg. Third, the tail (flagellum) is a long, whip-like structure that enables the sperm to swim through the female reproductive tract to reach the egg. The overall streamlined shape reduces resistance during swimming. Fourth, sperm cells have very little cytoplasm, making them small and lightweight, which allows for efficient swimming and enables the male to produce millions of sperm to increase the chances of successful fertilization. These adaptations reflect the sperm's specialized function: to deliver genetic material to the egg efficiently.",Medium,"This answer connects structure to function, a key biological principle. Understanding sperm adaptations helps explain why sperm and eggs are so different in structure despite both being gametes.","Think about what challenges a sperm faces (reaching the egg, penetrating its layers, providing energy) and how its structure addresses each.","1. Describe head (nucleus + acrosome for penetration)\n2. Describe midpiece (mitochondria for energy)\n3. Describe tail (flagellum for movement)\n4. Explain streamlined shape and minimal cytoplasm\n5.

Cortical granules in the egg's cytoplasm release their contents, which modify the zona pellucida (egg's outer layer) to create a fertilization membrane. This prevents additional sperm from entering, avoiding polyspermy, which would result in abnormal chromosome numbers.","Think about why it's important that only one sperm fertilizes an egg.","1. Multiple sperm would cause too many chromosomes\n2. The egg must block other sperm after first enters\n3. Cortical reaction modifies egg coating\n4. Answer: B"

They contain nuclei but very little cytoplasm, and they eventually degenerate. Their formation allows most of the cytoplasm and nutrients to remain in the single functional egg.","Consider why oogenesis produces unequal cells and what happens to the smaller cells.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,FreeResponse,"Compare spermatogenesis and oogenesis in terms of timing, number of functional gametes produced, and gamete size.","Spermatogenesis and oogenesis differ significantly in several aspects. First, regarding timing, spermatogenesis begins at puberty and continues throughout adult male life, producing sperm continuously. In contrast, oogenesis begins before birth, with cells arrested in prophase I until puberty, and then continues cyclically with typically one egg maturing per menstrual cycle until menopause. Second, in terms of number of functional gametes, spermatogenesis produces four functional sperm from each diploid cell that undergoes meiosis, resulting in millions of sperm being produced. Oogenesis produces only one functional egg from each diploid cell, with the other three cells becoming polar bodies that degenerate. Third, concerning gamete size, sperm are very small cells with minimal cytoplasm, adapted for motility. Eggs are much larger cells with abundant cytoplasm containing nutrients, organelles, and molecules needed to support early embryonic development. These differences reflect the different reproductive strategies: males produce many small, mobile gametes to maximize the chance of fertilization, while females produce few large, nutrient-rich gametes to support embryonic development.",Hard,"This answer provides a comprehensive comparison across multiple dimensions. Understanding these differences helps explain reproductive strategies and the complementary roles of male and female gametes in sexual reproduction.","Consider the differences in when, how many, and what size for each type of gamete production.","1.

Explain why differences exist (reproductive strategies)"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,FreeResponse,"Describe the sequence of events that occur during fertilization, from sperm-egg contact to zygote formation.","Fertilization involves a coordinated sequence of events. First, the sperm must travel through the female reproductive tract and undergo capacitation, which prepares it for fertilization. Second, when a sperm contacts the egg's outer layer (zona pellucida), it undergoes the acrosome reaction - the acrosome releases digestive enzymes that break down the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to reach the egg's plasma membrane. Third, the sperm's plasma membrane fuses with the egg's plasma membrane, and the sperm nucleus enters the egg's cytoplasm. Fourth, immediately after fusion, the egg undergoes the cortical reaction - cortical granules release their contents, modifying the zona pellucida to prevent additional sperm from entering (preventing polyspermy). Fifth, the egg completes meiosis II, which had been arrested at metaphase II. The completion of meiosis produces the second polar body. Sixth, the sperm nucleus and egg nucleus (now both haploid) migrate toward each other in the egg's cytoplasm. Finally, the two haploid nuclei fuse in a process called syngamy, combining the genetic material from both parents to form a diploid zygote nucleus. The zygote is now ready to begin cleavage and embryonic development.",Medium,"This answer presents fertilization as a sequential process with multiple checkpoints and reactions. Understanding this sequence helps explain how fertilization is regulated and how abnormalities can occur.","Follow the journey from sperm contact with the egg through to the formation of the diploid zygote.","1. Sperm contacts zona pellucida\n2. Acrosome reaction (enzyme release)\n3. Sperm-egg membrane fusion\n4. Cortical reaction (blocks polyspermy)\n5. Egg completes meiosis II\n6.

This would result in a zygote with too many chromosomes (e.g., triploid instead of diploid), which is usually lethal. The cortical reaction after fertilization prevents polyspermy by modifying the zona pellucida to block additional sperm.","Consider what would happen to chromosome number if two or more sperm entered the egg.","1. Normal fertilization: one sperm + one egg = diploid\n2. Polyspermy: multiple sperm + one egg = too many chromosomes\n3. This is abnormal and usually lethal\n4. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,FillBlank,"The fusion of the sperm nucleus and egg nucleus during fertilization is called ___.",syngamy,Hard,"Syngamy is the fusion of the two haploid gamete nuclei (sperm and egg) to form a single diploid nucleus in the zygote. This is the final step of fertilization that combines genetic material from both parents.","This Greek term means 'union of gametes' and refers specifically to nuclear fusion.","1.

Capacitation typically takes several hours.","This process 'makes the sperm capable' of fertilization - think of a word related to capability.","1. Sperm undergo changes in female tract\n2. These changes enable fertilization\n3. Process is called capacitation\n4. Answer: capacitation"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Developmental Biology (HL),Gametogenesis & Fertilization,FreeResponse,"Explain why genetic variation is important in sexually reproducing organisms and how gametogenesis contributes to this variation.","Genetic variation is crucial for sexually reproducing organisms because it provides the raw material for evolution and adaptation. Populations with greater genetic diversity are more likely to survive environmental changes, diseases, and other challenges because some individuals will have genetic combinations that allow them to survive and reproduce. Gametogenesis contributes to genetic variation through several mechanisms during meiosis. First, crossing over (recombination) during prophase I of meiosis exchanges segments of DNA between homologous chromosomes, creating new combinations of alleles that didn't exist in either parent. This shuffles genetic material along chromosomes. Second, independent assortment during metaphase I randomly distributes maternal and paternal chromosomes to daughter cells. For humans with $23$ chromosome pairs, this creates $2^{23}$ (over $8$ million) possible combinations of chromosomes in gametes, and when combined with a partner's gametes, over $70$ trillion possible genetic combinations in offspring. Third, random fertilization means any sperm can fertilize any egg, further increasing variation. Together, these mechanisms ensure that each offspring (except identical twins) is genetically unique, providing the variation necessary for natural selection to act upon and for populations to adapt to changing environments.",Hard,"This answer connects molecular processes (crossing over, independent assortment) to population-level outcomes (adaptation, evolution). Understanding the sources of genetic variation is fundamental to both genetics and evolutionary biology.","Consider why it's beneficial for offspring to be genetically different from their parents and siblings, and what happens during meiosis to create this variation.","1.
