IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,MCQ,"Why are restriction enzymes considered essential tools in genetic engineering?","[""A) They can create new genes"", ""B) They allow precise cutting of DNA at specific sequences"", ""C) They can prevent mutations"", ""D) They produce energy for DNA synthesis""]",B,Easy,"Restriction enzymes are essential because they cut DNA at specific, predictable sequences, allowing scientists to precisely manipulate DNA. This specificity enables targeted insertion or removal of genes, construction of recombinant DNA, and analysis of DNA structure. Without this precise cutting ability, genetic engineering would not be possible.","Consider what makes restriction enzymes different from random DNA-cutting methods.","1. Genetic engineering requires precise DNA manipulation\n2. Restriction enzymes recognize specific sequences\n3. Cut DNA at predictable locations\n4. This precision enables controlled DNA manipulation\n5. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,MCQ,"A plasmid used as a cloning vector typically contains which essential features?","[""A) Only a restriction site"", ""B) An origin of replication and a selectable marker (like antibiotic resistance)"", ""C) Multiple genes for different proteins"", ""D) A complete bacterial chromosome""]",B,Medium,"Cloning vectors (plasmids) must have an origin of replication (allows the plasmid to replicate in host cells) and a selectable marker such as antibiotic resistance genes (allows identification of cells that have taken up the plasmid). They also typically contain one or more restriction sites in a multiple cloning site (MCS) for inserting genes. These features are essential for successful cloning.","Think about what the plasmid needs to survive and be selected in bacterial cells.","1. Plasmid must replicate independently (origin of replication)\n2. Must identify which cells have the plasmid (selectable marker)\n3. Antibiotic resistance is common selectable marker\n4. Need restriction sites for gene insertion (usually present)\n5. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,MCQ,"After performing a ligation reaction to insert a gene into plasmids and transforming bacteria, a scientist finds that only 10% of colonies contain the recombinant plasmid while 90% contain religated empty plasmid. What would be the most effective way to identify the 10% with recombinant plasmids?","[""A) Use larger amounts of DNA ligase"", ""B) Screen colonies using PCR to amplify across the insertion site"", ""C) Increase the transformation temperature"", ""D) Use a different antibiotic""]",B,Hard,"PCR screening is an effective method to distinguish recombinant from non-recombinant clones. By designing primers that flank the insertion site, PCR will produce different sized products: a larger product if the gene is inserted (recombinant) and a smaller product if the plasmid religated without insert (non-recombinant). This allows rapid identification of successful clones. Other options would not help distinguish between the two types of colonies.","Consider how you could distinguish between plasmids with and without the insert.","1. Problem: need to identify which colonies have gene insert\n2. Both recombinant and empty plasmids confer antibiotic resistance\n3. PCR across insertion site will give different sized products\n4. Larger product = insert present (recombinant)\n5. Smaller product = no insert (religated empty)\n6. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,MCQ,"A 6 base pair recognition sequence for a restriction enzyme will occur on average once every how many base pairs in random DNA?","[""A) 6 base pairs"", ""B) 256 base pairs"", ""C) 4,096 base pairs"", ""D) 16,384 base pairs""]",C,Medium,"For a specific sequence of n base pairs, the probability of occurrence in random DNA is (1/4)$^n$ because each position can be any of 4 bases. For a 6 bp sequence: (1/4)$^6$ = 1/4,096. Therefore, a 6 bp recognition sequence occurs on average once every 4,096 bp. This principle explains why enzymes with longer recognition sequences cut DNA less frequently than those with shorter sequences.","Use the formula: probability = (1/4) raised to the power of sequence length.","1. Each nucleotide position has 4 possibilities (A, T, G, C)\n2. For specific 6 bp sequence: probability = (1/4)$^6$\n3. Calculate: (1/4)$^6$ = 1/4,096\n4. Occurs once every 4,096 bp on average\n5. Answer: C"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,FillBlank,"A plasmid that contains a foreign gene inserted into it is called a ___ plasmid.",recombinant,Easy,"A recombinant plasmid contains DNA from different sources combined together - typically a foreign gene inserted into a vector plasmid. The term 'recombinant' indicates that the DNA has been recombined or joined from multiple origins. This is the fundamental product of molecular cloning.","This term describes DNA that has been combined from different sources.","1. Plasmid contains inserted foreign gene\n2. DNA from different sources combined\n3. This is called recombinant DNA\n4. Answer: recombinant"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,FillBlank,"If a linear DNA molecule has 3 recognition sites for a particular restriction enzyme, cutting with that enzyme will produce ___ fragments.",4,Medium,"Each cut by a restriction enzyme creates two new ends. For a linear molecule: 0 cuts = 1 fragment; 1 cut = 2 fragments; 2 cuts = 3 fragments; 3 cuts = 4 fragments. The number of fragments equals the number of cuts plus one for linear DNA. (For circular DNA, cuts = fragments.)","Think about what happens each time you make a cut in a linear piece of DNA.","1. Start with linear DNA (1 fragment)\n2. Each cut divides a fragment into 2 pieces\n3. Pattern: 0 cuts → 1 fragment, 1 cut → 2, 2 cuts → 3, 3 cuts → 4\n4. Formula for linear DNA: fragments = cuts + 1\n5. Answer: 4"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,FillBlank,"Most plasmids used in cloning are ___ DNA molecules that replicate independently in bacterial cells.",circular,Easy,"Plasmids are naturally occurring circular DNA molecules found in bacteria. Their circular structure makes them stable and allows them to replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome using their own origin of replication. When cut with a restriction enzyme once, a circular plasmid becomes linear; when a gene is inserted and religated, it returns to circular form.","Think about the shape of bacterial plasmids in nature.","1. Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA in bacteria\n2. Most plasmids have a ring-like structure\n3. This shape is circular (vs. linear)\n4. Circular form is more stable\n5. Answer: circular"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,FreeResponse,"Outline the main steps involved in cloning a human gene into a bacterial plasmid for protein production. Include the roles of restriction enzymes and DNA ligase.","The gene cloning process involves these steps: (1) Isolation: The human gene of interest is isolated or synthesized, and a suitable plasmid vector is obtained. (2) Cutting: Both the gene and plasmid are cut with the same restriction enzyme(s) to create compatible ends (preferably sticky ends). The plasmid is cut at a restriction site within a multiple cloning site. (3) Ligation: The gene and cut plasmid are mixed with DNA ligase, which catalyzes formation of phosphodiester bonds to join them, creating a recombinant plasmid. (4) Transformation: The recombinant plasmid is introduced into bacterial cells through transformation. (5) Selection: Bacteria are grown on media containing antibiotics. Only cells with the plasmid (which carries antibiotic resistance) survive, and further screening identifies those with the recombinant plasmid containing the gene. (6) Expression: Selected bacteria are cultured to produce the human protein encoded by the inserted gene.",Medium,"Gene cloning combines molecular techniques (cutting with restriction enzymes, joining with ligase) with bacterial genetics (transformation, selection) to produce recombinant organisms that can express foreign genes. This process is fundamental to biotechnology applications.","Follow the logical sequence: get the DNA pieces, cut them, join them, put them into bacteria, select successful transformants.","1. Isolate human gene and plasmid vector\n2. Cut both with same restriction enzyme (creates compatible ends)\n3. Mix gene + cut plasmid + DNA ligase\n4. Ligase joins fragments → recombinant plasmid\n5. Transform bacteria with recombinant plasmid\n6. Select with antibiotics (plasmid has resistance gene)\n7. Screen for recombinant clones\n8. Culture bacteria to produce human protein"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Biotechnology (HL),Restriction Enzymes & DNA Ligation,FreeResponse,"Explain how antibiotic resistance genes in plasmid vectors are used for selection in cloning experiments. Why is additional screening often needed to identify recombinant plasmids?","Antibiotic resistance genes serve as selectable markers in cloning: (1) The plasmid vector contains an antibiotic resistance gene (e.g., ampicillin resistance). (2) After transformation, bacteria are grown on medium containing that antibiotic. Only cells that have taken up the plasmid survive because the resistance gene allows them to break down or tolerate the antibiotic. Cells without plasmids die. However, this selects for ANY plasmid, not specifically recombinant plasmids. Additional screening is needed because: (1) Many plasmids religate to themselves without incorporating the insert, creating non-recombinant plasmids that still confer antibiotic resistance. (2) Both recombinant and non-recombinant plasmids allow bacterial survival on antibiotic media. Additional methods are used to distinguish them: insertional inactivation (insert disrupts a second marker gene), blue-white screening (insert disrupts lacZ gene causing color change), or PCR screening (different product sizes for recombinant vs non-recombinant). These additional screens identify which antibiotic-resistant colonies actually contain the desired insert.",Hard,"Antibiotic selection is powerful but not sufficient alone - it only identifies cells with plasmids, not which plasmids contain inserts. Successful cloning requires a two-step selection: first for plasmid uptake (antibiotic), then for recombinant plasmids (additional screening).","Consider what antibiotic resistance tells you (plasmid present) versus what it doesn't tell you (whether insert is present).","1. Plasmid has antibiotic resistance gene\n2. Transform bacteria with plasmids\n3. Grow on antibiotic medium\n4. Only cells with plasmid survive (resistance)\n5. Problem: both recombinant and empty plasmids confer resistance\n6. Antibiotic selection doesn't distinguish between them\n7. Need additional screening: insertional inactivation, blue-white screening, or PCR\n8. This identifies which colonies have inserts"
