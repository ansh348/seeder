IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Energy Flow & Trophic Levels,FreeResponse,"Explain why energy flow through an ecosystem is unidirectional while nutrient cycling is cyclical.","Energy flow is unidirectional while nutrient cycling is cyclical due to fundamental differences in how energy and matter behave. Energy enters ecosystems as sunlight, is converted to chemical energy by producers, flows through consumers as they eat, and is ultimately lost as heat through cellular respiration at each trophic level. According to the second law of thermodynamics, energy transformations are inefficient, and the lost heat cannot be recaptured by organisms - it radiates into space. Therefore, ecosystems require a constant input of new solar energy. In contrast, nutrients (matter) such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are not lost from ecosystems but are recycled. When organisms die, decomposers break down their bodies, releasing nutrients back into the soil or water where producers can absorb and reuse them. These nutrients cycle repeatedly through the ecosystem via biogeochemical cycles. Matter is conserved and can be rearranged but not destroyed or converted to an unusable form like heat energy. This fundamental difference - energy degrades to heat and is lost, while matter is recycled - explains the different patterns. Ecosystems are open systems for energy (requiring constant input) but relatively closed systems for matter (recycling what's present).",Hard,"This answer explains the fundamental thermodynamic and physical principles underlying ecosystem function. Understanding why energy flows in one direction while matter cycles is key to comprehending ecosystem structure and function.","Think about what happens to energy (becomes heat and escapes) versus matter (changes form but stays in the system).","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Energy Flow & Trophic Levels,FreeResponse,"Describe the energy pyramid concept and explain what it reveals about ecosystem structure.","An energy pyramid is a graphical representation showing the amount of energy present at each trophic level in an ecosystem, with producers at the base and successive consumer levels above. The pyramid shape reflects the progressive decrease in available energy at higher trophic levels. At the base, producers capture solar energy through photosynthesis, typically around $1\\%$ of incident sunlight. When herbivores consume producers, only about $10\\%$ of the energy in plant tissue is converted to herbivore biomass - the rest is lost as heat through respiration, movement, and maintenance, or passes through as waste. This pattern continues at each level: secondary consumers obtain about $10\\%$ of the energy from primary consumers, tertiary consumers get $10\\%$ from secondary consumers, and so on. The energy pyramid reveals several important ecosystem principles. First, it explains why ecosystems can support many more producers than top predators - the energy base must be large enough to support the levels above. Second, it shows why food chains are typically short (3-5 levels) - insufficient energy remains for viable populations beyond this. Third, it explains why disrupting lower trophic levels has cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. Fourth, it illustrates why recovering populations of top predators is difficult - they require large areas with abundant prey to meet their energy needs. The pyramid also explains biomass patterns: typically, total biomass decreases at higher trophic levels (though there are exceptions in aquatic ecosystems where rapid producer turnover can result in inverted biomass pyramids, even though energy pyramids remain upright).",Medium,"This answer explains both what energy pyramids show and what they tell us about ecosystem function. The pyramid concept integrates multiple ecological principles including energy transfer, population sizes, and ecosystem stability.","Think about stacking blocks where each level has less than the one below - what does this structure tell you?","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Energy Flow & Trophic Levels,FreeResponse,"Explain why humans can feed more people by eating plants directly rather than by eating animals that ate plants.","Humans can feed more people by eating plants directly because eliminating trophic levels in the food chain reduces energy loss. When humans eat plants, they function as primary consumers, accessing energy at the second trophic level. However, when humans eat animals that ate plants, they function as secondary consumers, accessing energy at the third trophic level. Because approximately $90\\%$ of energy is lost between each trophic level, the energy available decreases dramatically. For example, if $10{,}000$ units of energy are captured by crop plants, herbivores that eat those plants would obtain only about $1{,}000$ units ($10\\%$), and humans eating those herbivores would obtain only about $100$ units ($10\\%$ of $1{,}000$). In contrast, humans eating plants directly would obtain $1{,}000$ units. This means that for the same amount of plant production, ten times more energy is available to humans if they eat plants directly. From a global food security perspective, this has important implications: land used to grow crops for direct human consumption can feed many more people than the same land used to grow crops for animal feed. This is why many argue that reducing meat consumption could help address world hunger. However, the reality is complex because not all land is suitable for crop production - some land can only support grazing animals - and animals can convert inedible plant material (grass, crop residues) into human-edible food (meat, milk). Additionally, cultural, nutritional, and economic factors influence food systems beyond simple energy efficiency.",Medium,"This answer connects trophic level energy transfer to practical applications in food production and global food security. Understanding these connections shows how ecological principles apply to real-world problems.","Think about how much energy is lost when you add an extra step (animal) between plants and humans.","1. Compare energy available eating plants vs animals\n2. Calculate energy at each level (using $10\\%$ rule)\n3. Show dramatic difference in energy available\n4. Connect to food security implications\n5. Note complexities (land use, cultural factors)"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Energy Flow & Trophic Levels,FreeResponse,"Describe three ways that energy is lost between trophic levels.","Energy is lost between trophic levels through several mechanisms. First, cellular respiration for maintenance, growth, and activity uses much of the consumed energy and releases it as heat. Animals must maintain body temperature (in endotherms), move, grow, reproduce, and maintain cellular processes, all of which require energy that is ultimately lost as heat according to the second law of thermodynamics. This typically accounts for the majority of energy loss. Second, not all consumed material is digested and absorbed. Herbivores cannot digest all plant material (like cellulose in cell walls), and carnivores cannot digest bones, fur, or feathers. This indigestible material passes through as feces, representing energy that was consumed but not incorporated into the consumer's biomass. Third, some energy is lost in waste products like urine, which contains nitrogen compounds from protein metabolism. Additionally, not all parts of prey organisms are consumed - predators may leave certain tissues uneaten. These energy losses combine to result in the typical energy transfer efficiency of approximately $10\\%$ between trophic levels. The remaining $90\\%$ is accounted for by these various pathways, with cellular respiration being the largest contributor. This low efficiency explains why ecosystems require constant energy input and why energy flow is unidirectional rather than cyclic.",Medium,"This answer explains the mechanisms of energy loss, connecting to fundamental biological and physical principles. Understanding how and why energy is lost helps explain ecosystem structure and energetics.","Think about what happens to food energy after an animal eats: some is used immediately, some passes through undigested, some is excreted.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Energy Flow & Trophic Levels,MCQ,"In an energy pyramid, which of the following is always true?","[""A) Each level contains more organisms than the level below"", ""B) Each level contains more biomass than the level below"", ""C) Each level contains less energy than the level below"", ""D) Each level contains larger organisms than the level below""]",C,Hard,"In an energy pyramid, each level always contains less energy than the level below due to energy loss during transfer. However, the relationship for numbers of organisms, biomass, or organism size is not always predictable. For example, one large tree (producer) might support thousands of insects (primary consumers), creating an inverted numbers pyramid. Similarly, in some aquatic ecosystems, rapidly reproducing phytoplankton can have less biomass than the zooplankton consuming them at any given time, though their productivity is higher.","Energy pyramids are always upright, but pyramids of numbers and biomass can sometimes be inverted.","1.

They play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and are sometimes considered a special trophic level because they feed on material from all other levels.","These organisms recycle nutrients by breaking down dead material.","1. Dead organisms and waste need breaking down\n2. Certain organisms do this job\n3. Called decomposers\n4. Answer: decomposers"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Energy Flow & Trophic Levels,FreeResponse,"Explain how the concept of trophic efficiency affects ecosystem productivity and structure.","Trophic efficiency - the percentage of energy transferred from one level to the next - profoundly affects ecosystem productivity and structure. With typical efficiency of about $10\\%$, ecosystems face strict energy constraints that shape their characteristics. First, trophic efficiency determines how much biomass can be supported at each level. Low efficiency means that each trophic level requires a large energy base below it. For example, supporting $1$ kg of top predator requires approximately $10$ kg of secondary consumers, $100$ kg of primary consumers, and $1{,}000$ kg of producers. This creates the characteristic pyramid shape of ecosystems. Second, trophic efficiency limits food chain length. With $90\\%$ energy loss per transfer, chains rarely exceed 4-5 levels because insufficient energy remains to support viable populations beyond this point. Third, variation in trophic efficiency between ecosystems affects their productivity. Aquatic ecosystems often have slightly higher efficiency than terrestrial ones because aquatic organisms don't invest energy in structural support against gravity, and temperature regulation costs less in water. Fourth, trophic efficiency influences ecosystem stability and resilience. Systems with higher efficiency can support more complex food webs with more alternative pathways, potentially making them more resilient to disturbances. Fifth, understanding trophic efficiency is crucial for ecosystem management and conservation. Protecting top predators requires ensuring sufficient productivity at lower levels - you cannot simply add top predators without ensuring adequate prey populations and producer productivity. Finally, trophic efficiency has practical applications in aquaculture and agriculture, where increasing efficiency even slightly can significantly increase yields. For example, feeding fish food that matches their nutritional needs improves conversion efficiency.",Hard,"This answer connects a fundamental ecological concept to multiple ecosystem properties and practical applications. Understanding trophic efficiency is key to understanding ecosystem function, structure, and management.","Consider how a $10\\%$ efficiency constraint ripples through and shapes an entire ecosystem.","1.
