This small size gives them an extremely high surface area to volume ratio. With such a high SA:V ratio, diffusion alone is sufficient to transport materials throughout the cell quickly, and there is no need for internal membrane systems to compartmentalize functions. All cellular processes can occur efficiently in the cytoplasm because no part of the cell is far from the membrane. This is why prokaryotes can function without the complex internal organization seen in eukaryotes.","Consider how the size of prokaryotic cells relates to their structural simplicity.","1. Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles\n2. Are very small ($1$-$5 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$)\n3. Small size = high SA:V ratio\n4. High SA:V = efficient diffusion throughout cell\n5.

This thin, elongated shape gives them a high surface area to volume ratio along their length, allowing efficient exchange of materials across their membrane. The small diameter ensures that the interior of the axon is never far from the surface, so diffusion remains effective. Neurons also have active transport systems and specialized structures that support their unique morphology. They do not divide after maturation.","Think about the shape of neurons - they are very long but also very thin.","1. Neurons can be over $1 \\, \\text{m}$ long\n2.

He called them ""cells"" because they reminded him of small rooms (cells) in a monastery. Although what Hooke observed were actually dead cell walls (cork is dead tissue), his work was pioneering in microscopy and established the term ""cell"" that we still use today. This was before cell theory was developed, but it laid important groundwork.","This English scientist published his microscopic observations in 'Micrographia' in 1665.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Cell Theory & Cell Size (SA:V),FillBlank,"For a cube, if the side length is $s$, the surface area to volume ratio can be expressed as ___.",6/s,Hard,"For a cube: Surface area = $6s^2$ (six faces, each $s^2$), Volume = $s^3$. SA:V ratio = $\\frac{6s^2}{s^3}$ = $\\frac{6}{s}$ or $6/s$. This formula reveals an important principle: as $s$ increases (cell gets bigger), the denominator increases and the ratio decreases. Conversely, smaller values of $s$ give larger SA:V ratios. This mathematical relationship explains why cells must stay small - the ratio is inversely proportional to cell size.","Calculate SA and V in terms of $s$, then create a ratio and simplify.","1. Cube surface area: SA = $6s^2$\n2. Cube volume: V = $s^3$\n3. Ratio: SA:V = $6s^2:s^3$\n4. Simplify by dividing: $\\frac{6s^2}{s^3}$\n5. Cancel $s^2$: $\\frac{6}{s}$ or $6/s$\n6. Answer: 6/s"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Cell Theory & Cell Size (SA:V),FreeResponse,"Explain why cell theory is considered a unifying theory in biology and discuss one exception or challenge to cell theory.","Cell theory is considered a unifying theory because it provides a common framework that applies to all living organisms, from the simplest bacteria to the most complex animals and plants. It establishes fundamental principles: (1) Life is cellular - all organisms are made of cells; (2) The cell is life's basic functional unit - even in multicellular organisms, life processes occur at the cellular level; (3) Cellular continuity - all cells have a common origin through cell division. This unifies biology by showing that despite enormous diversity, all life shares these common characteristics. Cell theory bridges different scales (molecular to organismal) and different organisms (prokaryotes to eukaryotes). Exception/Challenge: Viruses present a challenge to cell theory. Viruses are not composed of cells and cannot carry out life processes independently. They lack cellular structure, have no metabolism, and can only reproduce by hijacking host cells. This raises questions about whether viruses are ""living"" according to cell theory criteria. Some biologists exclude viruses from the definition of life, while others consider them life forms that represent an exception to cell theory. Another challenge: multinucleate cells like skeletal muscle fibers or fungal hyphae blur the definition of ""a cell"" - are they single cells or multiple cells? Despite these exceptions, cell theory remains valid for the vast majority of life and serves as biology's central organizing principle.",Hard,"Cell theory's power as a unifying theory comes from its universal applicability to diverse life forms, providing common ground for understanding all living systems.

Water moves by osmosis from areas of high water concentration to low water concentration, so water will move INTO the cell. As water enters, the cell swells. Red blood cells lack a cell wall and cannot withstand much pressure, so they may burst (lyse) in a strongly hypotonic solution. This process is called hemolysis.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Membrane Structure & Transport (Intro),FillBlank,"Transport proteins that create channels for specific ions or molecules to pass through the membrane facilitate ___ diffusion.",facilitated,Easy,"Facilitated diffusion is passive transport (no ATP required) that uses transport proteins to help molecules cross the membrane. It occurs down the concentration gradient, like simple diffusion, but requires a protein channel or carrier because the molecules cannot cross the lipid bilayer on their own (usually because they are polar, charged, or too large). Examples include glucose transporters and ion channels. The rate of facilitated diffusion can be saturated when all transport proteins are occupied.","This type of diffusion requires transport proteins to help molecules cross.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Membrane Structure & Transport (Intro),FreeResponse,"Describe the structure of the phospholipid bilayer and explain how this structure makes the membrane selectively permeable.","The phospholipid bilayer consists of two layers of phospholipid molecules arranged with their hydrophilic (polar) phosphate heads facing outward toward the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, and their hydrophobic (nonpolar) fatty acid tails facing inward, away from water. This arrangement forms spontaneously because it is thermodynamically favorable - polar heads interact with water while nonpolar tails avoid it. The bilayer structure makes the membrane selectively permeable: (1) Small, nonpolar molecules ($\\ce{O2}$, $\\ce{CO2}$, lipids) can easily pass through the hydrophobic core of the membrane by simple diffusion; (2) Small, uncharged polar molecules (water, glycerol) can pass through slowly; (3) Large polar molecules (glucose, amino acids) and charged ions ($\\ce{Na+}$, $\\ce{K+}$, $\\ce{Cl-}$) cannot cross the hydrophobic core and require transport proteins to cross; (4) The membrane is impermeable to very large molecules like proteins. This selective permeability allows the cell to control what enters and exits, maintaining different internal and external environments essential for cellular function. The hydrophobic core acts as a barrier to polar and charged substances, while the presence of specific transport proteins determines which of these restricted substances can cross and how quickly.",Medium,"The bilayer's amphipathic structure creates a hydrophobic barrier that permits free passage of nonpolar molecules while restricting polar and charged molecules.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Cell Biology,Membrane Structure & Transport (Intro),FreeResponse,"Compare and contrast active transport and passive transport (including simple and facilitated diffusion). Include the role of concentration gradients and energy requirements.","Passive and active transport are fundamentally different mechanisms for moving substances across membranes: Passive Transport: (1) No energy (ATP) required - uses kinetic energy of molecules; (2) Moves substances DOWN their concentration gradient (high to low); (3) Two types: Simple diffusion (directly through lipid bilayer for small nonpolar molecules like $\\ce{O2}$, $\\ce{CO2}$) and Facilitated diffusion (through protein channels or carriers for polar molecules and ions); (4) Continues until equilibrium is reached; (5) Rate depends on concentration gradient and, for facilitated diffusion, availability of transport proteins. Active Transport: (1) Requires energy, usually from ATP hydrolysis; (2) Moves substances AGAINST their concentration gradient (low to high); (3) Always requires transport proteins (pumps); (4) Maintains concentration gradients rather than reaching equilibrium; (5) Example: $\\ce{Na+}$-$\\ce{K+}$ pump moves $\\ce{Na+}$ out and $\\ce{K+}$ in against their gradients; (6) Can be saturated when all pump proteins are working at maximum rate. Similarities: Both can involve transport proteins; both are selective (only certain substances); both are crucial for cell function. The key distinction is that active transport can work against concentration gradients by coupling to energy sources, while passive transport only works down gradients. This allows cells to maintain internal conditions very different from their surroundings, which is essential for life.",Hard,"Active transport enables cells to defy thermodynamic equilibrium by investing energy to maintain concentration gradients, while passive transport represents the natural tendency toward equilibrium.

Facilitated diffusion also moves substances down gradients passively, but uses protein channels or carriers to help polar molecules and ions cross. Active transport is unique in requiring ATP to power protein pumps that move substances against their concentration gradients. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion specifically referring to water movement across selectively permeable membranes. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for predicting how different substances move across membranes.","Organize by: (1) what crosses, (2) direction relative to gradient, (3) proteins needed, (4) energy needed.","1.
