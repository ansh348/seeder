IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FreeResponse,"Explain how ice core data provides evidence for past climate conditions and current climate change.","Ice core data provides evidence for past climate conditions through analysis of air bubbles and isotopes trapped in ancient ice. As snow accumulates and compresses into ice over thousands of years in places like Antarctica and Greenland, it traps atmospheric gases and other materials. Scientists drill deep into ice sheets to extract cores that represent different time periods. Air bubbles in the ice contain samples of the ancient atmosphere, allowing direct measurement of past $\\ce{CO2}$ and other greenhouse gas concentrations. Additionally, isotope ratios in the ice (particularly oxygen isotopes) provide information about past temperatures. Ice core records extending back $800{,}000$ years show that current $\\ce{CO2}$ levels (over $400$ parts per million) are higher than at any point in this record, and the rate of increase is unprecedented. These cores also reveal that temperature and $\\ce{CO2}$ levels are closely correlated historically, supporting the link between greenhouse gases and global temperature. The ice core evidence demonstrates that current warming is occurring at an unusually rapid rate and is associated with atmospheric $\\ce{CO2}$ levels that exceed the natural range of the past $800{,}000$ years.",Medium,"This answer explains both how ice cores preserve climate information and what that information reveals about current climate change.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FreeResponse,"Describe three impacts of climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity.","Climate change has multiple significant impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. First, shifting temperature and precipitation patterns force species to migrate to new areas to find suitable conditions. Species that cannot migrate fast enough, such as alpine plants or polar species with nowhere colder to go, face extinction. This leads to changes in species distributions and can disrupt existing ecological communities. Second, climate change alters the timing of biological events (phenology), such as flowering, migration, and breeding. If species that interact closely (like pollinators and plants, or predators and prey) shift their timing differently, mismatches occur that can reduce reproductive success and population survival. Third, rising temperatures and changing conditions increase stress on ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to other threats. For example, coral reefs are experiencing widespread bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures, and warmer conditions promote forest pest outbreaks and increase wildfire frequency. These impacts don't occur in isolation - they interact and can amplify each other, leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Some ecosystems may reach tipping points where they transform into different ecosystem types, such as forests becoming grasslands.",Medium,"This answer covers multiple types of impacts and explains their biological mechanisms. Understanding climate change impacts on biodiversity is important for conservation biology and demonstrates the interconnected nature of ecological systems.","Consider how temperature changes affect where species can live, when they reproduce, and how they interact with other species.","1. Describe range shifts and migration pressures\n2. Explain phenological mismatches\n3. Discuss increased ecosystem stress\n4. Provide specific examples\n5.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),MCQ,"Why is methane ($\\ce{CH4}$) considered a potent greenhouse gas despite its lower atmospheric concentration compared to $\\ce{CO2}$?","[""A) Methane stays in the atmosphere longer than $\\ce{CO2}$"", ""B) Methane absorbs more heat per molecule than $\\ce{CO2}$"", ""C) Methane reflects sunlight back to space"", ""D) Methane is heavier than $\\ce{CO2}$""]",B,Hard,"Methane is approximately $25$-$28$ times more effective at trapping heat than $\\ce{CO2}$ over a $100$-year period.

Identify activities that release greenhouse gases\n2. Recycling reduces emissions\n3. It's a solution, not a contributor\n4. Answer: D"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FillBlank,"The decrease in ocean pH due to absorption of atmospheric $\\ce{CO2}$ is called ocean ___.",acidification,Medium,"Ocean acidification occurs as oceans absorb increasing amounts of atmospheric $\\ce{CO2}$, forming carbonic acid and lowering pH. This threatens marine organisms with calcium carbonate structures, such as corals, mollusks, and some plankton, as lower pH makes it harder to build and maintain these structures.","This process makes ocean water more acidic.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FillBlank,"The measurement of past temperatures using oxygen isotope ratios in ice cores is based on the principle that isotope ratios change with ___.",temperature,Hard,"The ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in ice depends on the temperature at which the water evaporated and later fell as snow. Warmer periods have different isotope ratios than colder periods because lighter isotopes evaporate more easily at lower temperatures. By measuring these ratios in ice layers, scientists can reconstruct past temperatures.","What environmental variable affects the ratio of heavy to light oxygen isotopes?","1. Isotope ratios vary with conditions\n2. Temperature affects evaporation patterns\n3. This relationship allows temperature reconstruction\n4. Answer: temperature"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FreeResponse,"Evaluate the claim that 'climate has always changed naturally, so current warming is not a concern.'","While it is true that Earth's climate has changed naturally throughout its history, this claim misrepresents the significance of current climate change in several important ways. First, the rate of current warming is exceptionally rapid compared to past natural changes. Temperature increases that took thousands of years in the past are now occurring over decades, giving ecosystems and species much less time to adapt. Second, we understand the mechanism of current warming - increased greenhouse gases from human activities - and can directly measure both the cause ($\\ce{CO2}$ increases from fossil fuels) and the effect (rising temperatures). Past natural changes had different causes such as volcanic activity, solar variations, or orbital cycles. Third, current warming is occurring at a time when Earth would naturally be slowly cooling based on orbital cycles, meaning human influence has overwhelmed natural factors. Fourth, the concern is not just that climate is changing, but that the rate and magnitude of change threaten human societies and natural ecosystems. Past natural climate changes caused mass extinctions and major ecosystem disruptions; the fact that changes can be natural doesn't make them harmless. Fifth, unlike past changes, current warming affects a world with $8$ billion people, extensive infrastructure, and agricultural systems adapted to current climate conditions. The existence of past natural climate change does not diminish concerns about rapid anthropogenic change - if anything, understanding how devastating natural changes were in the past should increase concern about rapid human-caused change.",Hard,"This answer addresses a common misconception by acknowledging the truth (climate has changed naturally) while explaining why this doesn't diminish current concerns. This type of critical evaluation of claims is important in IB Biology and demonstrates scientific reasoning.","Consider: just because something can happen naturally doesn't mean human-caused versions aren't concerning.","1. Acknowledge climate has changed naturally\n2. Contrast rate of current vs past changes\n3. Explain we know the cause of current change\n4. Note current change opposes natural trends\n5. Discuss impacts on ecosystems and human systems\n6. Conclude that natural changes don't excuse concerns"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FreeResponse,"Explain the greenhouse effect and how human activities enhance it.","The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps Earth warm enough to support life. Solar radiation (visible light) passes through the atmosphere and warms Earth's surface. The warmed surface emits infrared radiation (heat) back toward space. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb much of this infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions, including back toward Earth's surface. This trapping of heat keeps Earth's average temperature around $15°$C instead of $-18°$C, which it would be without the greenhouse effect. The main greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Human activities enhance this natural process primarily through burning fossil fuels, which releases $\\ce{CO2}$ that had been stored underground for millions of years. Deforestation reduces the removal of $\\ce{CO2}$ from the atmosphere. Agriculture produces methane from livestock and rice paddies, and nitrous oxide from fertilizers. Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric $\\ce{CO2}$ has increased from about $280$ parts per million to over $400$ parts per million. This enhanced greenhouse effect causes additional warming beyond what occurs naturally. The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat is trapped, leading to rising global temperatures. This is often called the 'enhanced greenhouse effect' or 'anthropogenic global warming' to distinguish it from the natural greenhouse effect that has always existed.",Medium,"This answer explains both the natural process and human enhancement, showing how normal atmospheric function becomes a problem when greenhouse gas concentrations increase. Understanding the greenhouse effect is fundamental to climate science.","Think about how a greenhouse traps heat, but remember the atmospheric process works differently.","1. Explain natural greenhouse effect\n2. Describe how sunlight becomes heat\n3. Explain greenhouse gas absorption of infrared\n4. State normal temperature benefit\n5. List main greenhouse gases\n6. Explain human activities increasing gases\n7. Provide concentration data\n8. Connect to enhanced warming"

Tide gauges\n\nMeasurements:\nA) Current sea level changes\nB) Historical atmospheric gas concentrations\nC) Past temperature and precipitation patterns\nD) Current global temperature distribution","[""1-B"", ""2-C"", ""3-D"", ""4-A""]","1-B, 2-C, 3-D, 4-A",Medium,"Different types of evidence provide different information about climate. Ice cores preserve ancient atmosphere, tree rings record annual growth influenced by climate, satellites provide global current data, and tide gauges measure sea level. Using multiple evidence types strengthens scientific conclusions.","Match past atmospheric, past terrestrial, current global, and current water level measurements.","1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),MCQ,"What is a positive feedback loop in the climate system?","[""A) A process that reduces the initial warming"", ""B) A process that amplifies the initial warming"", ""C) A beneficial effect of climate change"", ""D) The ocean absorbing $\\ce{CO2}$""]",B,Hard,"A positive feedback loop amplifies changes in the climate system. For example, as Arctic ice melts, darker ocean water is exposed. Dark water absorbs more heat than reflective ice, causing more warming, which melts more ice. This amplification makes climate change more difficult to control once started.","In climate science, 'positive' means amplifying, not necessarily good.","1. Feedback loops affect climate change\n2. Positive feedback amplifies changes\n3. Creates self-reinforcing cycles\n4. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FillBlank,"The phenomenon where loss of Arctic ice leads to more heat absorption and further warming is an example of a positive ___ loop.",feedback,Medium,"This is a positive feedback loop because the effect (warming) amplifies the cause (ice loss). As ice melts, reflective white ice is replaced by dark ocean water, which absorbs more sunlight, causing more warming and more ice melt. This self-reinforcing process accelerates climate change.","This type of loop reinforces and amplifies the initial change.","1. Ice melt exposes dark water\n2. Dark water absorbs more heat\n3. More heat melts more ice\n4. Answer: feedback"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FreeResponse,"Discuss why understanding past climate change helps scientists predict future climate change.","Understanding past climate change helps scientists predict future change in several important ways. First, paleoclimate data (from ice cores, sediments, and tree rings) provides information about how Earth's climate system responds to changes in factors like greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation, and volcanic activity. By studying how climate responded to past changes, scientists can test and refine climate models to ensure they accurately represent Earth's climate system. Second, past climate records show the relationship between $\\ce{CO2}$ levels and temperature. Ice core data demonstrates that periods with higher $\\ce{CO2}$ were warmer, confirming the theoretical prediction that greenhouse gases cause warming. Third, past climate changes reveal the magnitude of effects that can occur. For example, during past warm periods, sea levels were much higher, showing what could happen with continued warming. Fourth, studying past rapid climate changes helps identify potential tipping points and feedback mechanisms that could accelerate future change. Fifth, paleoclimate data extends our understanding beyond the short period of instrumental measurements ($\sim 150$ years), providing context for current changes. When scientists see that current $\\ce{CO2}$ levels exceed anything in the past $800{,}000$ years, it provides perspective on the unprecedented nature of current change. Finally, understanding how ecosystems and species responded to past climate changes helps predict potential future impacts on biodiversity. While past climate changes had different causes than current anthropogenic change, the physical and biological responses provide valuable information for predicting future effects.",Hard,"This answer explains how historical data informs future predictions through multiple mechanisms. Understanding the connection between past and future is important for appreciating how scientific predictions are made and validated.","Consider how studying past events in any field helps predict future events.","1. Explain paleoclimate data sources\n2. Describe model testing and validation\n3. Discuss $\\ce{CO2}$-temperature relationships\n4. Explain magnitude of potential effects\n5. Discuss tipping points and feedbacks\n6. Provide context for current changes\n7. Connect to ecosystem and biodiversity impacts"

This conclusion is based on multiple lines of evidence including direct measurements, attribution studies, and climate models. The IPCC states it is 'extremely likely' (95-100% probability) that human influence is the dominant cause.","Consider which statement aligns with the scientific consensus supported by evidence.","1. Review evidence for warming causes\n2. Attribution studies identify human influence\n3. Scientific consensus supports option B\n4. Answer: B"
IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Ecology,Climate Change: Evidence & Impacts (Intro),FillBlank,"The gradual shift in the geographic range of a species in response to changing climate conditions is called range ___.",shift,Easy,"Range shift occurs when species move to new areas to track suitable climate conditions, typically poleward or to higher elevations as temperatures warm.
