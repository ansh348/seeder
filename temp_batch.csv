How do neurons encode information about stimulus intensity if action potentials are all-or-none?","The all-or-none principle states that once threshold potential is reached, an action potential will fire with maximum amplitude (approximately 100 mV change from -70 to +40 mV); stimuli below threshold produce no action potential, while stimuli above threshold produce identical action potentials regardless of stimulus strength. This principle ensures reliable signal transmission over long distances without degradation. However, neurons encode stimulus intensity through frequency coding (rate coding): stronger stimuli cause more frequent action potentials rather than larger ones. For example, a bright light causes photoreceptors to trigger more action potentials per second in the optic nerve than a dim light. Additionally, stronger stimuli may recruit more neurons (population coding). The all-or-none principle thus enables digital-like reliability while frequency and population coding provide analog information about stimulus properties.",Medium,"The all-or-none principle ensures consistent signal propagation, while the nervous system encodes stimulus intensity through the frequency of action potentials rather than their amplitude.

This is lower than atmospheric \ce{PO2} (~160 mm Hg) because inspired air mixes with residual alveolar air and because oxygen continuously diffuses into capillary blood. Alveolar \ce{PO2} of 100 mm Hg creates the pressure gradient driving oxygen diffusion into blood (where venous \ce{PO2} is ~40 mm Hg). This gradient is essential for efficient gas exchange.",Remember that alveolar values are between atmospheric and blood values.,"1. Atmospheric \ce{PO2} at sea level ≈ 160 mm Hg
2. Alveolar air is diluted by residual volume

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology (HL),Gas Exchange: Ventilation/Perfusion Matching,FillBlank,"The movement of oxygen from alveoli into the blood occurs by simple ___ down a concentration gradient.",diffusion,Easy,"Diffusion is the passive movement of molecules from high to low concentration. Oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane (alveolar epithelium, basement membranes, and capillary endothelium—total thickness ~0.5 $\mu m$) from alveolar air (\ce{PO2} ≈ 100 mm Hg) into blood (\ce{PO2} ≈ 40 mm Hg in deoxygenated blood). This process requires no energy and is driven solely by the partial pressure gradient. Fick's law describes the rate of diffusion based on surface area, thickness, and pressure gradient.",This passive process requires no energy and follows concentration gradients.,"1. Oxygen moves from high to low concentration

Inside red blood cells, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction: \ce{CO2 + H2O <=> H2CO3 <=> H+ + HCO3-}. The bicarbonate ions diffuse into plasma while chloride ions move into RBCs (chloride shift) to maintain electrical neutrality.

Include at least four structural features and their functional significance.","Alveoli have multiple structural adaptations for efficient gas exchange: (1) Large total surface area (~70 m²)—millions of alveoli provide extensive area for simultaneous diffusion of \ce{O2} and \ce{CO2}; (2) Thin respiratory membrane (~0.5 $\mu m$)—the barrier between air and blood consists of alveolar epithelium, fused basement membranes, and capillary endothelium, minimizing diffusion distance; (3) Rich capillary network—each alveolus is surrounded by dense capillaries, maximizing blood contact and maintaining concentration gradients; (4) Moist surface—the thin fluid layer dissolves gases, facilitating diffusion while surfactant reduces surface tension; (5) Extensive ventilation and perfusion—continuous breathing and blood flow maintain steep concentration gradients, driving rapid diffusion according to Fick's law. Together, these features enable the lungs to oxygenate ~5 L of blood per minute at rest.",Medium,"Alveolar structure exemplifies the relationship between form and function, with features like large surface area, thin membranes, and rich blood supply working together to maximize gas exchange efficiency according to physical principles of diffusion.",Consider how each structural feature relates to factors affecting diffusion rate.,"1.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology (HL),Gas Exchange: Ventilation/Perfusion Matching,FreeResponse,"Analyze the significance of ventilation-perfusion matching for efficient gas exchange. Explain what happens when V/Q ratios deviate from optimal values and describe the body's compensatory mechanisms.","Optimal gas exchange requires ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching, where airflow and blood flow to alveoli are proportional (ideal V/Q ≈ 0.8-1.0). When V/Q ratios deviate, gas exchange efficiency decreases: (1) Low V/Q (shunt)—occurs when perfusion exceeds ventilation (e.g., airway obstruction, fluid-filled alveoli). Blood passes through poorly ventilated regions without adequate oxygenation, causing hypoxemia. This cannot be corrected by supplemental oxygen alone. (2) High V/Q (dead space)—occurs when ventilation exceeds perfusion (e.g., pulmonary embolism). Ventilated alveoli receive insufficient blood flow, wasting ventilatory effort and impairing \ce{CO2} removal. The body compensates through: (a) Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction—blood vessels constrict in poorly ventilated areas, redirecting blood to well-ventilated regions; (b) Local airway responses—\ce{CO2} levels affect bronchiolar diameter, with low alveolar \ce{CO2} causing bronchoconstriction to reduce wasted ventilation. These mechanisms optimize matching but cannot fully compensate for severe mismatches, which manifest as respiratory failure.",Hard,"V/Q matching is essential for efficient gas exchange because blood must encounter well-ventilated alveoli. Mismatches cause hypoxemia or impaired \ce{CO2} removal, and while the body has compensatory mechanisms, severe mismatches can cause respiratory failure.",Think about what happens when air and blood are not in the same place at the same time.,"1. Ideal scenario: ventilation matches perfusion (V/Q ≈ 1)
2. Low V/Q (shunt): blood bypasses gas exchange → hypoxemia
3. High V/Q (dead space): wasted ventilation → poor \ce{CO2} removal
4. Compensation: hypoxic vasoconstriction redirects blood
