When activated by antigen presentation and helper T cell signals, B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce and secrete large quantities of specific antibodies (immunoglobulins). These antibodies circulate in blood and lymph, binding to antigens and marking pathogens for destruction. Some activated B cells become memory B cells for rapid response upon re-exposure. Direct cell killing is performed by cytotoxic T cells, not B cells.",Think about which immune cells produce the proteins that circulate in blood to fight infections.,"1.

Memory B and T cells, generated during the primary response, enable rapid and robust reactions. The secondary response has several advantages: (1) Shorter lag time (days vs. 1-2 weeks); (2) Higher antibody titers (concentration); (3) Antibodies have higher affinity due to affinity maturation; (4) Longer-lasting antibody production; (5) Predominantly IgG production rather than IgM.

All nucleated cells express MHC I and display samples of intracellular proteins on their surface. When cells are infected by viruses or become cancerous, they present abnormal (foreign or mutated) antigens on MHC I. Cytotoxic T cells scan for these antigen-MHC I complexes and, upon recognition, release perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis in the target cell. This mechanism allows the immune system to eliminate infected cells before pathogens can replicate.

When a B or T cell's receptor binds to its specific antigen, that cell becomes activated and undergoes rapid cell division (clonal expansion), producing many identical copies (clones). For B cells, this produces both plasma cells (antibody-secreting) and memory B cells. For T cells, this produces effector T cells and memory T cells. This ensures that cells capable of fighting the specific pathogen are amplified, while maintaining diversity for other potential threats.

Include details about the heavy and light chains, variable and constant regions, and the Fab and Fc regions.","An antibody (immunoglobulin) has a characteristic Y-shaped structure consisting of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, held together by disulfide bonds. Each chain has a variable (V) region and a constant (C) region. The variable regions of one heavy and one light chain combine to form the antigen-binding site at the tips of the Y (Fab regions—Fragment antigen-binding). Since there are two arms, each antibody has two identical antigen-binding sites, allowing bivalent binding. The variable regions contain hypervariable regions (complementarity-determining regions) that determine antigen specificity—different antibodies have different variable regions for recognizing different antigens. The constant region (Fc region—Fragment crystallizable) forms the stem of the Y and determines the antibody class (IgG, IgM, etc.) and its effector functions: complement activation, opsonization (marking for phagocytosis), and binding to Fc receptors on immune cells. This structure enables antibodies to both specifically recognize antigens and recruit other immune components for pathogen elimination.",Medium,"Antibody structure reflects its dual function: specific antigen recognition (variable regions in Fab) and immune system activation (constant region in Fc).

Describe the key cell types involved in each, the types of pathogens they are most effective against, and provide examples of each type of response.","Cell-mediated and humoral immunity are the two branches of adaptive immunity, each specialized for different threats. Cell-mediated immunity involves T lymphocytes, particularly cytotoxic T cells (\ce{CD8+}) that directly kill infected or abnormal cells, and helper T cells (\ce{CD4+}) that coordinate immune responses. This branch is most effective against intracellular pathogens (viruses, some bacteria like \textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}), cancer cells, and transplanted tissue. Cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens presented on MHC I molecules and induce apoptosis through perforin and granzymes. Example: elimination of virus-infected cells before viral replication completes. Humoral immunity involves B lymphocytes that differentiate into plasma cells producing antibodies (immunoglobulins). This branch is most effective against extracellular pathogens (bacteria, toxins, viruses in blood before cell entry). Antibodies neutralize pathogens, activate complement, opsonize for phagocytosis, and prevent pathogen attachment to host cells. Example: antibodies against \textit{Streptococcus} bacteria causing neutralization and phagocytosis. Both systems work synergistically: helper T cells activate both cytotoxic T cells (via cytokine release) and B cells (via direct interaction and cytokine signaling). Memory cells in both branches provide long-term immunity.",Hard,"Cell-mediated immunity (T cells) targets intracellular threats by killing infected cells, while humoral immunity (B cells/antibodies) targets extracellular threats by neutralizing and marking pathogens.

It appears within days of initial exposure and is produced before class switching occurs. IgM exists as a pentamer (five antibody units joined together), giving it 10 antigen-binding sites, which makes it highly effective at agglutinating (clumping) pathogens and activating complement despite lower individual binding affinity. As the immune response matures, B cells undergo class switching to produce primarily IgG, which has higher affinity and can cross the placenta.

Antibodies (particularly IgG) and complement proteins (especially C3b) act as opsonins. Phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils have Fc receptors that bind to the Fc region of antibodies and complement receptors that bind to complement proteins. When a pathogen is opsonized, these receptors facilitate attachment and trigger more efficient phagocytosis and destruction.

Once inside, the virus replicates, ultimately killing the host cell. Helper T cells are central coordinators of adaptive immunity—they activate cytotoxic T cells, stimulate B cells, and coordinate many immune responses through cytokine secretion. As HIV progressively destroys helper T cells over years, the immune system loses its ability to coordinate effective responses against pathogens. When \ce{CD4+} counts drop below ~200 cells/$\mu L$ (normal: 500-1500), the person develops AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and becomes vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers that healthy immune systems easily control.

They are produced artificially through hybridoma technology: a B cell producing the desired antibody is fused with an immortal myeloma (cancer) cell to create a hybrid cell line that produces limitless quantities of identical antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies have numerous applications: diagnostic tests (pregnancy tests, COVID-19 tests), cancer therapy (e.g., trastuzumab for breast cancer), autoimmune disease treatment, and research. Their exquisite specificity makes them powerful tools, unlike polyclonal antibodies (natural immune response products) which are mixtures of antibodies from many B cell clones recognizing different epitopes on the same antigen.",Think about the meaning of \"mono\" (one) versus \"poly\" (many) clonal.,"1.

Immature T cells (thymocytes) migrate from bone marrow to the thymus, where they undergo positive selection (selecting cells that can recognize MHC molecules) and negative selection (eliminating cells that strongly recognize self-antigens to prevent autoimmunity). Only about 2-4% of thymocytes survive both selection processes. The thymus is most active during childhood and gradually atrophies after puberty, though some T cell production continues throughout life.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology (HL),Immunity: B/T Cells & Antibody Production,FillBlank,"The type of immunity where antibodies are transferred from mother to infant through breast milk or across the placenta is called ___ immunity.",passive,Hard,"Passive immunity involves receiving pre-formed antibodies from an external source rather than producing them yourself. Natural passive immunity occurs when IgG antibodies cross the placenta from mother to fetus (providing protection for the first few months of life) and when IgA antibodies are transferred through breast milk (protecting the infant's digestive and respiratory tracts). Artificial passive immunity involves injection of antibodies (immunoglobulins) for immediate protection against toxins (e.g., tetanus antitoxin, snake antivenin) or infections. Passive immunity provides immediate but temporary protection (weeks to months) because the transferred antibodies eventually degrade and no memory cells are formed. This contrasts with active immunity, which takes longer to develop but provides lasting protection through memory cells.",This type provides immediate but temporary protection without memory cells.,"1. Two types of acquired immunity: active and passive

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology (HL),Immunity: B/T Cells & Antibody Production,FreeResponse,"Explain the principle of vaccination and describe how it leads to immunological memory. Discuss why booster shots are sometimes necessary and provide an example of a vaccine that requires boosters.","Vaccination works by exposing the immune system to a harmless form of a pathogen or its antigens without causing disease, thereby inducing active immunity and immunological memory. Vaccines contain attenuated (weakened) pathogens, inactivated (killed) pathogens, subunit components (purified proteins), toxoids (inactivated toxins), or genetic material (mRNA or DNA) encoding pathogen proteins. When administered, these antigens activate B and T cells through the normal adaptive immune response: (1) Antigen-presenting cells process and present vaccine antigens; (2) Helper T cells are activated; (3) B cells are activated and undergo clonal selection and expansion; (4) Some B and T cells differentiate into memory cells that persist for years to decades. Upon subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen, memory cells enable a rapid, robust secondary immune response that neutralizes the pathogen before disease develops. Booster shots are sometimes necessary because memory cell populations and antibody titers can decline over time, particularly for antigens that don't provide strong initial immune stimulation. Boosters re-expose the immune system to the antigen, reactivating memory cells and generating additional memory cells, thus maintaining protective immunity. Example: Tetanus vaccine requires boosters every 10 years because antibody levels decline over time, and tetanus toxin exposure is rare (so no natural boosting occurs). Other examples include pertussis (whooping cough) and COVID-19 vaccines.",Medium,"Vaccination harnesses the adaptive immune system's ability to create memory cells without causing disease. Memory B and T cells provide rapid protection upon real pathogen exposure.

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology (HL),Immunity: B/T Cells & Antibody Production,FreeResponse,"Describe the process of T cell activation, including the role of antigen presentation, MHC molecules, T cell receptors, and co-stimulatory signals. Explain why two signals are required for T cell activation and what happens if only one signal is received.","T cell activation requires two distinct signals to prevent inappropriate immune responses: Signal 1 (Antigen Recognition): A T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell must recognize and bind to a specific antigen presented on an MHC molecule on an antigen-presenting cell (APC). For helper T cells (\ce{CD4+}), this is antigen-MHC II; for cytotoxic T cells (\ce{CD8+}), this is antigen-MHC I. The TCR-CD4/CD8 complex recognizes the antigen-MHC combination, providing specificity. However, this signal alone is insufficient for activation. Signal 2 (Co-stimulation): Co-stimulatory molecules on the APC (such as B7) must bind to co-stimulatory receptors on the T cell (such as CD28). This second signal confirms that the APC is a professional APC that has encountered genuine pathogen-associated signals, not just self-antigens. When both signals are present, the T cell becomes fully activated, proliferates (clonal expansion), differentiates into effector cells, and begins secreting cytokines. The two-signal requirement is a crucial safety mechanism: if a T cell receives only Signal 1 without Signal 2 (for example, by recognizing antigen on a non-professional APC or a tissue cell), the T cell enters a state of anergy (functional unresponsiveness) or undergoes apoptosis. This prevents autoimmune responses by ensuring T cells only activate in the context of genuine infection (when professional APCs are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns). This mechanism is exploited therapeutically: checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy block inhibitory co-stimulatory signals to enhance T cell activity against tumors.",Hard,"T cell activation requires dual signals: antigen recognition (specificity) and co-stimulation (confirmation of genuine threat). This two-signal system prevents autoimmunity by ensuring T cells only activate during real infections when APCs are properly activated. Without co-stimulation, T cells become unresponsive (anergy).",Think about why the immune system needs a confirmation system before activating powerful T cells.,"1. Signal 1: TCR recognizes antigen-MHC complex
   - Provides specificity for target
   - Helper T: antigen-MHC II; Cytotoxic T: antigen-MHC I
2. Signal 2: Co-stimulation (B7-CD28 interaction)
   - Confirms genuine pathogen encounter
   - Only professional APCs provide this

For heavy chains: one V + one D + one J; for light chains: one V + one J. Combinatorial diversity (different V, D, J combinations), junctional diversity (random nucleotide additions/deletions at junctions), and the pairing of different heavy and light chains generate billions of possible antibodies.

Epitopes can be linear (sequential amino acids in a protein) or conformational (formed by amino acids brought together by protein folding). The exquisite specificity of antibody-epitope interaction (like lock and key) is determined by the complementary shapes and chemical properties of the antibody's variable region and the epitope. Understanding epitopes is important for vaccine design, diagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.",This is the specific molecular structure that antibodies recognize on antigens.,"1. Antigens are molecules recognized by immune system
2. Antibodies bind to specific parts of antigens

IB,Grade 12,Biology HL,Animal Physiology (HL),Immunity: B/T Cells & Antibody Production,FreeResponse,"Explain the concept of herd immunity and describe how it protects individuals who cannot be vaccinated. Discuss the threshold percentage of vaccinated individuals needed and factors that influence this threshold.","Herd immunity (population immunity) occurs when a sufficient proportion of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, either through vaccination or prior infection, thereby providing indirect protection to non-immune individuals. When most people are immune, transmission chains are frequently broken because infected individuals encounter mostly immune people rather than susceptible ones, preventing epidemic spread. This protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (infants too young for vaccines, immunocompromised individuals, those with allergies to vaccine components). The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is calculated as HIT = 1 - (1/R₀), where R₀ is the basic reproduction number (average number of people one infected person will infect). For highly contagious diseases like measles (R₀ ≈ 15-18), approximately 95% of the population must be immune. For less contagious diseases like influenza (R₀ ≈ 1.5-2), the threshold is lower (~50-70%). Factors influencing the threshold include: (1) Transmission mode—respiratory diseases spread more easily than contact-transmitted diseases; (2) Population density—urban areas require higher coverage than rural areas; (3) Contact patterns—diseases affecting children may require high childhood vaccination rates; (4) Vaccine efficacy—if vaccines are not 100% effective, higher coverage is needed. Herd immunity is a crucial public health concept that demonstrates how individual vaccination decisions affect community health. When vaccination rates drop below the threshold, outbreaks can occur even among vaccinated individuals, as seen in recent measles outbreaks in undervaccinated communities.",Hard,"Herd immunity protects the entire population, including vulnerable individuals, by reducing disease transmission when enough people are immune. The required threshold depends on disease contagiousness (R₀) and ranges from 50-95%. It exemplifies how individual immunity creates collective protection.",Consider how immunizing some people protects others who cannot be immunized.,"1. High vaccination coverage protects community
2. Immune individuals break transmission chains
3. Protects those who cannot be vaccinated
4. Threshold depends on disease R₀: HIT = 1 - (1/R₀)
5. Measles very contagious → needs ~95% coverage
6. Less contagious diseases need lower coverage
7. Factors: transmission mode, density, contact patterns
8. Below threshold → outbreaks can occur"
